# PasswordGenerator UI Synchronization Manual Test Checklist

## Test Overview
This checklist validates the UI synchronization fix in the PasswordGenerator component where toggle switches didn't reflect the actual settings used for password generation when the modal opened.

## Prerequisites
- Start the development server: `npm run dev`
- Login to the application
- Navigate to a page where PasswordGenerator can be triggered (e.g., Asset Identity Vault, Standalone Credentials)

## Critical Test Scenarios

### ✅ Test 1: Modal Opening State Reset
**Objective**: Verify that opening the modal resets to default configuration

**Steps**:
1. Open the PasswordGenerator modal
2. Observe the initial state immediately upon opening

**Expected Results**:
- Length slider shows 16 (default)
- Uppercase toggle: ON (checked)
- Lowercase toggle: ON (checked) 
- Numbers toggle: ON (checked)
- Special characters toggle: ON (checked)
- Exclude ambiguous toggle: ON (checked)
- A password is automatically generated immediately
- The generated password reflects all character types being enabled

### ✅ Test 2: UI Toggle State Matches Generation Parameters
**Objective**: Ensure toggle switches visually reflect the actual generation settings

**Steps**:
1. Open the PasswordGenerator modal
2. Verify each toggle switch visual state
3. Check the generated password characteristics

**Expected Results**:
- Toggle switches show correct checked/unchecked state
- Generated password contains uppercase letters (A-Z)
- Generated password contains lowercase letters (a-z)
- Generated password contains numbers (0-9)
- Generated password contains special characters (!@#$...)
- Generated password excludes ambiguous characters (0, O, l, I, 1)
- Password length is 16 characters

### ✅ Test 3: Auto-Generation on Modal Open
**Objective**: Verify password is auto-generated immediately when modal opens

**Steps**:
1. Open the PasswordGenerator modal
2. Observe the password field immediately

**Expected Results**:
- Password field is not empty
- Password appears without clicking "Generate" button
- Password strength analysis is performed automatically
- Strength indicator appears with score

### ✅ Test 4: Toggle Switch Interaction
**Objective**: Ensure toggles work correctly after modal opens

**Steps**:
1. Open the PasswordGenerator modal
2. Toggle OFF the "Uppercase (A-Z)" switch
3. Observe the password field and generation

**Expected Results**:
- Switch visually changes to OFF state
- Password automatically regenerates
- New password contains no uppercase letters
- Other character types remain in password

### ✅ Test 5: State Persistence Reset
**Objective**: Verify state resets on each modal open

**Steps**:
1. Open the PasswordGenerator modal
2. Change some settings (e.g., turn off uppercase, change length to 24)
3. Close the modal
4. Reopen the modal

**Expected Results**:
- All settings return to defaults (length 16, all toggles ON)
- Previous custom settings are not remembered
- Fresh password is generated with default settings

### ✅ Test 6: Length Slider Synchronization
**Objective**: Verify length slider matches generation

**Steps**:
1. Open the PasswordGenerator modal
2. Check the length slider position
3. Verify the generated password length

**Expected Results**:
- Slider shows position at 16
- Generated password is exactly 16 characters long
- Changing slider immediately regenerates password with new length

### ✅ Test 7: Form Field Consistency
**Objective**: Ensure form state matches internal state

**Steps**:
1. Open the PasswordGenerator modal
2. Make several toggle changes
3. Check that password generation reflects current form state

**Expected Results**:
- Changes to form immediately affect password generation
- No delay between toggle change and regeneration
- Generated password always matches current form settings

## Edge Case Testing

### ✅ Test 8: Rapid Modal Open/Close
**Objective**: Test stability with rapid interactions

**Steps**:
1. Rapidly open and close the modal 5 times
2. On final open, verify state

**Expected Results**:
- Modal works correctly after rapid cycling
- State properly resets to defaults
- No JavaScript errors in console

### ✅ Test 9: Invalid Configuration Handling
**Objective**: Test behavior when no character types selected

**Steps**:
1. Open the PasswordGenerator modal
2. Turn OFF all character type toggles
3. Observe validation and button states

**Expected Results**:
- Warning message appears: "At least one character type must be selected"
- Generate button becomes disabled
- "Use This Password" button becomes disabled

### ✅ Test 10: Password Strength Integration
**Objective**: Verify strength analysis works with auto-generation

**Steps**:
1. Open the PasswordGenerator modal
2. Observe strength indicator
3. Change settings and observe strength updates

**Expected Results**:
- Strength indicator appears immediately after generation
- Score is reasonable for default settings (should be high)
- Strength updates when settings change

## Bug Validation Criteria

### The Original Bug (FIXED):
- ❌ **Before Fix**: Toggle switches didn't reflect actual generation settings when modal opened
- ✅ **After Fix**: Toggle switches accurately show the settings used for password generation

### Key Validation Points:
1. **Immediate State Sync**: Toggle switches show correct state the moment modal opens
2. **Auto-Generation**: Password generates immediately with correct settings
3. **Visual Consistency**: What you see in toggles matches what's used for generation
4. **State Reset**: Each modal open starts fresh with default settings
5. **Real-time Updates**: Changes to toggles immediately affect generation

## Browser Console Checks
- No JavaScript errors during modal operations
- No warning messages about uncontrolled components
- No memory leaks from repeated open/close cycles

## Performance Validation
- Modal opens quickly without delays
- Password generation is nearly instantaneous
- No lag between toggle changes and regeneration
