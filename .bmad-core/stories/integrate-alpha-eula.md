# Story: Integrate Alpha EULA

## Story
Integrate an Alpha End-User License Agreement (EULA) that displays every time the application runs, requiring user acceptance before proceeding to the main application.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] EULA modal displays on every application startup
- [ ] Modal contains the complete Alpha EULA text with proper formatting
- [ ] Two buttons: "Decline" and "Agree and Continue"
- [ ] Clicking "Decline" exits the application
- [ ] Clicking "Agree and Continue" closes modal and proceeds to main app
- [ ] Modal cannot be dismissed without making a choice (no X button, no clicking outside)
- [ ] EULA text is properly styled and readable
- [ ] Modal is responsive and works on different screen sizes

## Tasks
- [x] Create EULA modal component with complete text and styling
- [x] Implement EULA state management in Zustand store
- [x] Add EULA display logic to main App component
- [x] Implement "Decline" button functionality to exit application
- [x] Implement "Agree and Continue" button functionality
- [x] Style EULA modal with proper typography and layout
- [x] Add tests for EULA component and functionality
- [x] Test application exit behavior on decline

## Dev Notes
- EULA should display before any other application functionality
- Use Ant Design Modal component for consistency
- Consider using Tauri's exit API for the decline functionality
- Ensure EULA is accessible and properly formatted
- Modal should be modal (blocking) and cannot be bypassed

## Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for EULA component rendering
- [ ] Unit tests for button functionality
- [ ] Integration tests for app startup flow
- [ ] Manual testing of decline/accept flows
- [ ] Accessibility testing for modal
