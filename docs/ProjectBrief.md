# Brainstorming Session Results

Session Date: July 17, 2025

Facilitator: Business Analyst Mary

Participant: User

## Executive Summary

**Topic:** A secure, 100% offline platform for OT and ICS engineers to manage industrial equipment configurations, including golden image management, change tracking, and handling of proprietary formats.

**Session Goals:** Broad and open-ended exploration of the platform concept.

**Techniques Used:** What If Scenarios, Analogical Thinking

**Total Ideas Generated:** 8

**Key Themes Identified:**

- Security and Trust through Verification
    
- Usability for OT/ICS Engineers (Non-Developers)
    
- Scalable and Flexible Workflows
    
- Robust Version Control and Disaster Recovery

## Technique Sessions

### What If Scenarios - 20 minutes

**Description:** Exploring the boundaries of the problem by posing hypothetical situations to uncover requirements and challenges.

**Ideas Generated:**

1. In a disaster recovery scenario, the platform must provide access to a local database of configurations that has been regularly and securely backed up.
    
2. The platform must clearly distinguish "approved for production" configurations from others, using strong visual warnings and confirmation screens ("stop screens") to prevent accidental deployment of incorrect versions.
    
3. For changes to binary/proprietary files that cannot be "diffed," the engineer making the change must provide a detailed commit message, including test results and a rollback plan.
    
4. For critical equipment, all changes must be verified via a digital twin or a physical test PLC before they can receive the highest level of approval. Configurations without this testing must be clearly labeled as such.
    

**Insights Discovered:**

- A simple "approved" status is insufficient; the platform needs multiple **Verification Levels or Trust Tiers** (e.g., Untested, Lab Tested, Production Verified) to ensure safety.
    
- The platform must solve the "black box" problem of binary files by enforcing a robust process of documentation and accountability on the user submitting the change.
    
- The core disaster recovery loop is central to the platform's value.
    

### Analogical Thinking (using Git/GitHub) - 15 minutes

**Description:** Using familiar systems like Git and GitHub as a model to define features and workflows for the platform.

**Ideas Generated:**

1. A full "Pull Request" system might be overly complex for small (1-2 person) OT teams and should be an optional, configurable feature for larger enterprises.
    
2. **Branching** is an essential core feature, allowing engineers to safely experiment on configurations without risk to the "main" or "golden" version.
    
3. **Tagging** is the correct model for "blessing" a specific version as an official "Golden Image."
    
4. The tagging process must be simplified for non-developers, likely through an automated or wizard-driven "Promote to Golden" feature rather than a manual Git-like command.
    

**Insights Discovered:**

- A core design principle is the need for **scalable workflows** that support both a lone engineer and a highly structured enterprise team.
    
- The platform must **adapt** software development concepts for the OT/ICS user, not just copy them. The user experience must be intuitive for this specific audience.

## Idea Categorization

### Immediate Opportunities

_Ideas ready to implement now_

1. **Core Versioning with Branching:** The fundamental ability to save versions of configurations and create branches for experimentation.
    
2. **Guided Golden Image Tagging:** A user-friendly wizard to "bless" a version as a golden image.
    
3. **Clear Status Indicators:** Simple, clear labels for configurations (e.g., `Draft`, `Approved`, `Golden`).
    

### Future Innovations

_Ideas requiring development/research_

1. **Configurable Approval Workflows:** The ability to turn on/off multi-person approvals (like Pull Requests) based on team size or policy.
    
2. **Digital Twin Integration:** Building the framework to connect to digital twin platforms for automated testing and verification.
    

### Moonshots

_Ambitious, transformative concepts_

1. **Proprietary Format Analysis:** A system that could, without vendor software, perform some level of heuristic analysis or metadata extraction on proprietary binary configs to detect potentially malicious or accidental changes.
    

### Insights & Learnings

_Key realizations from the session_

- Usability for the non-developer OT/ICS engineer is the most critical success factor.
    
- Trust is built through verifiable testing and clear status levels, not just a simple approval.
    
- An "offline" system presents unique challenges for secure off-site backup and synchronization that must be addressed carefully.

## Action Planning

### Top 3 Priority Ideas

1. **Secure Versioned Repository:** Implement the core database and logic to store configuration files (including binaries) with a full version history. This is the foundation of everything.
    
    - **Next steps:** Define database schema, storage strategy for binaries.
        
2. **Branching Functionality:** Develop the core feature for creating and managing branches from existing configurations.
    
    - **Next steps:** Design the data model to handle branching. Create the basic UI for viewing and creating branches.
        
3. **Golden Image Management (Tagging & Status):** Create the system for applying "Golden" tags and other statuses to configuration versions, with a simple UI for promotion.
    
    - **Next steps:** Implement the status and tagging system. Design the "Promote to Golden" wizard.
