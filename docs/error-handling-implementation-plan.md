## Technical Dependency Analysis

### Critical Path Dependencies

1. **EH-1.1 → EH-1.2**: Error type system must exist before conversion layer
2. **Phase 1 → EH-2.1**: Enhanced errors needed for request correlation
3. **EH-2.1 → EH-2.2**: Request IDs needed for frontend correlation display
4. **Phase 1&2 → EH-3.1**: Error classification needed for retry decisions
5. **EH-3.1 → EH-3.2**: Retry mechanisms needed for graceful degradation integration
6. **All Previous → Phase 4**: Advanced features require complete foundation

### Parallel Development Opportunities
