# High Level Architecture

## Technical Summary

The system is a cross-platform desktop application built using the Tauri framework, which features a Rust backend for maximum security and performance, and a React frontend for a polished user interface. It operates primarily as a modular monolith in an offline-first model, storing all data in a local, encrypted SQLite database. A monorepo structure will manage the codebase. For the optional, intermittent sync feature, the application will communicate with a secure, serverless backend hosted on AWS, ensuring scalability and cost-efficiency. The architecture prioritizes security, data integrity, and a responsive, intuitive experience for OT engineers.

## Platform and Infrastructure Choice

- **Platform:** AWS (Amazon Web Services) will be used for the optional sync and update functionality.
    
- **Key Services:** AWS Lambda (for compute), API Gateway (for the sync endpoint), S3 (for software update storage), and Cognito (for potential future cloud identity services).
    
- **Deployment Host and Regions:** The desktop application is self-hosted by the user. The serverless backend will be deployed to `us-east-1` and `eu-west-1` for redundancy.
    

## Repository Structure

- **Structure:** Monorepo.
    
- **Monorepo Tool:** Turborepo is recommended to manage workspaces and optimize build processes.
    
- **Package Organization:** The monorepo will contain separate packages for the Tauri application (`apps/desktop`) and any future cloud infrastructure or shared libraries (`packages/shared-types`).

## Architectural Patterns

- **Modular Monolith (Desktop App):** The core application is a single deployable unit, but its internal code will be structured in a modular way to ensure maintainability and separation of concerns.
    
- **Serverless (Cloud Sync):** The backend for handling software updates and optional telemetry will be built using serverless functions to ensure it is scalable and cost-effective.
    
- **Component-Based UI:** The React frontend will be built as a collection of reusable, stateless, and well-defined components.
    
- **Repository Pattern (Rust Core):** The Rust backend will use the repository pattern to abstract the database logic from the core business logic.
