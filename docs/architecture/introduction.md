# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for the Secure OT Configuration Management Platform, including the backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

The project will be built using the Tauri framework, which integrates a Rust-based backend with a web-based frontend. This choice was finalized in the PRD and serves as our foundational "starter," providing a secure, performant, and cross-platform application shell from the outset.
