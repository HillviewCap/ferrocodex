# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for FerroCodex (Secure OT Configuration Management Platform), including the backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. The v0.3.0 release introduces the Integrated Firmware Management feature set, evolving the platform into a comprehensive asset recovery solution. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

The project is built using the Tauri framework, which integrates a Rust-based backend with a web-based frontend. This choice was finalized in the PRD and serves as our foundational "starter," providing a secure, performant, and cross-platform application shell from the outset.
