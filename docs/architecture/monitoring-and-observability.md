# Monitoring and Observability

_(This section defines the strategy for monitoring the application, using local file-based logging for the desktop app and AWS CloudWatch for the optional cloud backend. It also lists the key metrics to be collected.)_

This concludes the `greenfield-fullstack` planning workflow. All required artifacts—the Project Brief, PRD, UI/UX Specification, and this Architecture Document—are now complete.

The project is fully specified and ready to transition from planning to the development phase. The next step is to move to an IDE environment where a **Scrum Master** will begin creating user stories for the **Developer** to implement, starting with Epic 1.

Thank you for your collaboration. The BMad team is ready for the next phase when you are.
