## Notes

This story represents the final layer of sophistication for hierarchical asset management, building upon the solid foundation of 5.1A (data layer) and 5.1B (basic UI components). It focuses on power-user features that enable efficient management of large, complex hierarchies through bulk operations, advanced interactions, and polished user experience. The implementation emphasizes accessibility, performance, and user empowerment while maintaining the security and data integrity established in the prerequisite stories.

The advanced features in this story transform the basic hierarchy management into a professional-grade organizational tool suitable for managing hundreds or thousands of industrial assets across complex facility structures.
