## Notes

This story creates a comprehensive asset creation workflow that guides Engineers through a structured process of creating complete asset records. The wizard ensures all required information is collected, validated, and properly classified before any files are imported, establishing a solid foundation for the asset-first configuration workflow. The implementation focuses on user experience, data integrity, and seamless integration with existing systems while providing robust persistence and recovery capabilities.
