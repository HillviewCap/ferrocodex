# Story 5.5A: Enhanced Tree Navigation

## Story Overview

- **Epic**: 5 - Asset-Centric Hierarchical Management
- **Story ID**: 5.5A
- **Story Points**: 8
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: Ready for Development

## User Story Statement

**As an** Engineer  
**I want** advanced tree navigation with virtualization and persistent state management  
**So that** I can efficiently browse and navigate large hierarchical asset structures with thousands of assets while maintaining optimal performance.

## Dependencies

- **Requires Completion of**:
  - Story 5.1B: Tree UI Components (basic tree structure and components)
  - Story 5.2C: Metadata Search Infrastructure (search integration capabilities)

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Virtualized Tree Navigation Performance
- **Given** a hierarchical asset structure with 1000+ assets
- **When** I navigate through the tree interface
- **Then** the tree should render without performance degradation
- **And** only visible tree nodes should be rendered in the DOM
- **And** scrolling should remain smooth with consistent frame rates
- **And** memory usage should remain stable regardless of tree size

### AC2: Persistent Tree State Management
- **Given** I have expanded multiple tree nodes and navigated to specific assets
- **When** I close and reopen the application
- **Then** the tree expansion state should be restored exactly as I left it
- **And** my current navigation position should be preserved
- **And** selected assets should remain highlighted
- **And** state restoration should complete within 500ms

### AC3: Advanced Breadcrumb Navigation
- **Given** I am navigating deep hierarchical structures (5+ levels)
- **When** I view any asset in the hierarchy
- **Then** a breadcrumb trail should show the complete path from root to current asset
- **And** each breadcrumb segment should be clickable for quick navigation
- **And** breadcrumbs should truncate intelligently for very deep hierarchies
- **And** hover states should show full path information in tooltips

### AC4: Keyboard Navigation and Accessibility
- **Given** I am using the tree navigation interface
- **When** I use keyboard controls
- **Then** arrow keys should navigate between tree nodes
- **And** Enter/Space should expand/collapse nodes
- **And** Tab navigation should follow logical focus order
- **And** screen readers should announce tree structure and current position
- **And** all interactive elements should have appropriate ARIA labels

### AC5: Performance Optimization Features
- **Given** I am working with large asset hierarchies
- **When** I interact with the tree interface
- **Then** nodes should load lazily as they become visible
- **And** frequently accessed nodes should be cached in memory
- **And** search results should be cached for repeated queries
- **And** tree state changes should be debounced to prevent excessive updates
- **And** background preloading should occur for likely-to-be-accessed nodes
