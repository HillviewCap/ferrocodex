# Story 1.4: Import Configuration and Create First Version

## Story Information

- **Epic:** 1 - Foundation & Core Versioning
- **Story:** 1.4
- **Title:** Import Configuration and Create First Version
- **Status:** Completed
- **Points:** 8
- **Assignee:** Development Agent

## Story Statement

As an Engineer, I want to import a configuration file for a new asset, so that it is securely stored and versioned in the platform.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. From the main dashboard, a logged-in user can select an "Import Configuration" action.
2. The user is prompted to select a file from their local system.
3. The user must provide a name for the asset/device (e.g., "PLC-Line5") and can add initial commit notes.
4. Upon saving, the file is stored encrypted in the local database.
5. A new version record (v1) is created, associated with the asset, and includes the author's username, timestamp, and notes.
6. The newly created asset appears on the main dashboard.
