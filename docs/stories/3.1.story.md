## Dev Notes

### Validation Summary
- **Epic Source:** Validated against docs/prd/epic-3-integrated-firmware-management-v030.md Epic 3, Story 3.1 (lines 6-21)
- **Architecture Alignment:** Verified hybrid storage model design from high-level-architecture.md
- **Database Schema:** Confirmed firmware_versions table structure from database-schema.md
- **Tech Stack:** Validated binwalk crate (~3.1.0) for future firmware analysis capability

### Previous Story Context
From Epic 2 completion, the following patterns and infrastructure are established:
- Repository pattern for data access (see `configurations/mod.rs`, `assets/mod.rs`)
- Encrypted storage using AES-256 (see `encryption/mod.rs`)
- Audit trail integration for all operations
- Role-based permission system (Engineer vs Administrator)
- Consistent error handling and validation patterns
- Frontend component patterns with Ant Design (modals, cards, lists)
- Zustand store pattern for state management

### Technical Framework Details
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md and package.json/Cargo.toml]
- **Backend Language:** Rust 1.78.0
- **Frontend:** TypeScript 5.4.5, React 18.3.1, Ant Design 5.17.4
- **State Management:** Zustand 4.5.2
- **Database:** SQLite with rusqlite 0.31.0
- **Encryption:** Existing AES-256 implementation in encryption module
- **Future Enhancement:** binwalk crate 3.1.0 for firmware analysis (Story 3.2)

### Architecture Specifications
[Source: docs/architecture/high-level-architecture.md]
- **Hybrid Storage Model:** Metadata in encrypted SQLite, binary files in encrypted file system
- **File Storage Location:** Platform-specific app data directory (same as database)
- **Security:** All firmware files must be encrypted before storage
- **Performance:** File operations should be async to prevent UI blocking

### Database Schema for Firmware
[Source: docs/architecture/database-schema.md - lines 26-40]
```sql
CREATE TABLE firmware_versions (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
    asset_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    author_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    vendor TEXT,
    model TEXT,
    version TEXT NOT NULL,
    notes TEXT,
    status TEXT NOT NULL CHECK(status IN ('Draft', 'Golden', 'Archived')),
    file_path TEXT NOT NULL, -- Path to the encrypted file on the file system
    file_hash TEXT NOT NULL, -- SHA-256 hash of the encrypted file
    created_at TEXT NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (asset_id) REFERENCES assets(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (author_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE RESTRICT
);
```

### File System Structure
Firmware files should be stored in:
- Windows: `%APPDATA%/ferrocodex/firmware/{asset_id}/{firmware_id}.enc`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/ferrocodex/firmware/{asset_id}/{firmware_id}.enc`
- Linux: `~/.local/share/ferrocodex/firmware/{asset_id}/{firmware_id}.enc`

### Testing Standards
[Source: Analysis of existing test patterns]
- **Backend Tests:** Use Rust's built-in test framework with `#[cfg(test)]` modules
- **Test Database:** Use `tempfile::NamedTempFile` for temporary SQLite databases
- **Test Pattern:** Create `setup_test_db()` function for test initialization
- **Frontend Tests:** Use Vitest with React Testing Library
- **Mock Tauri:** Use `vi.mock('@tauri-apps/api/core')` for IPC testing
- **Test Location:** Backend tests in same file as module, frontend tests in `__tests__` directory

### UI Layout Guidance

#### Asset Detail View Tab Structure
The Firmware tab should be integrated into the existing asset detail view alongside the current tabs. Expected tab order:
1. Overview (existing)
2. Configuration History (existing)
3. **Firmware** (new)
4. Branches (existing if applicable)

#### Firmware Tab Layout
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Firmware Management]                                    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │
│ │ [Upload Firmware] button (Engineer role only)       │ │
│ │ Shows upload modal when clicked                     │ │
│ └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ │
│                                                          │
│ [Firmware Versions List]                                 │
│ ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │
│ │ Version Card 1                                      │ │
│ │ - Vendor: [vendor] | Model: [model]                │ │
│ │ - Version: [version]                                │ │
│ │ - Uploaded: [date] by [user]                        │ │
│ │ - Size: [file size] | Hash: [first 8 chars]...     │ │
│ │ - Status: [Draft/Golden/Archived badge]             │ │
│ │ - Actions: [...] dropdown (Delete option)           │ │
│ └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ │
│ ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │
│ │ Version Card 2...                                   │ │
│ └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Upload Modal Layout
Follow the existing `ImportConfigurationModal.tsx` pattern but adapt for firmware:
- Title: "Upload Firmware"
- Ant Design Upload.Dragger component for drag-and-drop
- Form fields: Vendor (optional), Model (optional), Version (required), Notes (optional)
- Show upload progress bar during file transfer
- Display file name and size during/after selection
- Cancel and Upload buttons

#### Component Styling
- Use existing Ant Design theme and spacing conventions
- Follow the card-based layout pattern from `VersionCard.tsx`
- Status badges should match `ConfigurationStatusBadge.tsx` styling
- Action dropdowns follow the pattern in `VersionCard.tsx`

### Role-Based Access Summary
- **Engineer Role:**
  - Can view firmware tab
  - Can upload new firmware files
  - Can delete firmware versions
  - Can view all firmware metadata
- **Administrator Role:**
  - All Engineer permissions
  - Future: Can change firmware status (not in this story)

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-23
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
The implementation demonstrates good understanding of the codebase patterns and successfully implements the firmware management feature. The code follows existing repository patterns, uses proper encryption, and integrates well with the current architecture. However, a critical implementation bug was discovered that prevents the feature from functioning.

### Refactoring Performed
- **File**: `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/lib.rs`
  - **Change**: Changed `file_data: Vec<u8>` parameter to `file_path: String` in upload_firmware command
  - **Why**: Backend expected raw file bytes but frontend was sending file path, causing a type mismatch
  - **How**: Aligned with existing pattern from import_configuration to read file from path using file_utils
  
- **File**: `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/lib.rs`
  - **Change**: Added file path validation and malicious input checks
  - **Why**: Security best practices require validating all user inputs
  - **How**: Added InputSanitizer::validate_file_path() and is_potentially_malicious() checks

- **File**: `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/lib.rs`
  - **Change**: Added file reading logic using file_utils::read_file_content()
  - **Why**: Need to read file content from the provided path
  - **How**: Following the same pattern as import_configuration command

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: [✓] Code follows existing patterns and conventions
- Project Structure: [✓] Files organized according to unified project structure
- Testing Strategy: [✓] Added comprehensive test coverage (delete functionality, integration tests)
- All ACs Met: [✓] All acceptance criteria implemented successfully

### Improvements Checklist
[Check off items you handled yourself, leave unchecked for dev to address]

- [x] Fixed critical file upload implementation bug (backend expected bytes, frontend sent path)
- [x] Added malicious input validation for all text fields
- [x] Added file path validation using InputSanitizer
- [x] Add comprehensive tests for delete functionality in FirmwareVersionList
- [x] Add integration tests for complete upload → list → delete workflow
- [x] Implement rate limiting for firmware upload operations
- [x] Add file type validation (whitelist allowed firmware extensions)
- [ ] Consider streaming large files instead of loading into memory
- [x] Add form validation tests in FirmwareUploadModal
- [x] Test error scenarios and edge cases more thoroughly

### Security Review
**Critical Issues Found and Fixed:**
- File upload implementation mismatch (FIXED)
- Missing malicious input validation (FIXED)
- Missing file path validation (FIXED)

**Remaining Security Considerations:**
- No rate limiting on upload operations (DoS risk)
- No file type validation (accepts any file)
- Large files loaded entirely into memory (potential memory exhaustion)
- Consider adding virus/malware scanning integration point

### Performance Considerations
- Loading 2GB files into memory could cause performance issues
- Consider implementing streaming for large file uploads
- File operations are properly async to prevent UI blocking

### Final Status
[✓ Approved - Ready for Done]

**Developer Response Validation Results:**

✅ **Successfully Completed:**
- Added comprehensive test coverage for delete functionality (6 test cases verified)
- Created integration tests for complete workflow (FirmwareIntegration.test.tsx verified)
- Implemented rate limiting for firmware uploads (10 requests per minute per user)
- Added form validation tests (6 test cases verified)
- Added error scenario tests (3 test cases verified)
- Fixed TypeScript compilation errors
- **Backend file type validation implemented** (see implementation details below)

✅ **Security Issue - Now Properly Implemented:**
- **File type validation**: Complete implementation with both frontend and backend validation:
  - Frontend has file extension validation in the UI (dialog filter and validation function)
  - **Backend now validates file extensions** against the same whitelist of 23 allowed types
  - **Backend includes basic MIME type checking** to detect and reject Windows executables
  - File extension validation occurs before file reading to prevent processing of invalid files

### Final QA Verification - Security Fix Confirmed

I've verified the backend security implementation and can confirm all critical issues have been resolved:

✅ **Backend File Extension Validation (Lines 1961-1988)**:
- Validates against exact same whitelist as frontend (23 allowed types)
- Rejects files without extensions
- Clear error messages indicating allowed types
- Validation occurs before file processing

✅ **MIME Type Validation (Lines 1999-2012)**:
- Detects Windows executable signatures (MZ header)
- Properly rejects disguised .exe files
- Allows legitimate firmware formats (ELF)
- Prevents malicious executable uploads

✅ **Complete Security Implementation**:

**Backend Security Implementation Details:**
1. **File Extension Validation** (lines 1962-1988 in lib.rs):
   - Validates against whitelist of 23 allowed extensions
   - Rejects files without extensions
   - Validation occurs before file processing
   - Clear error messages indicate allowed file types

2. **MIME Type Validation** (lines 1999-2012 in lib.rs):
   - Checks file headers for Windows executable signatures (MZ header)
   - Allows ELF format (common for embedded firmware)
   - Prevents upload of Windows .exe files disguised with firmware extensions

3. **Defense in Depth**:
   - Frontend validation provides immediate user feedback
   - Backend validation ensures security even if frontend is bypassed
   - Rate limiting prevents abuse (10 uploads/minute per user)
   - All inputs sanitized for malicious content

The streaming optimization for large files remains deferred as acceptable for this iteration.

### Developer Response #2 - Security Fix
Thank you for catching this critical security vulnerability. I've now implemented comprehensive backend validation:

1. **Backend File Type Validation** (lib.rs lines 1962-1988):
   - Extracts and validates file extension from path
   - Checks against the same whitelist used in frontend (23 allowed types)
   - Rejects files without extensions
   - Returns clear error messages

2. **MIME Type Checking** (lib.rs lines 1999-2012):
   - Examines file headers to detect Windows executables (MZ signature)
   - Prevents disguised .exe files from being uploaded
   - Allows legitimate firmware formats like ELF

3. **Validation Order**:
   - Rate limiting check first (prevent DoS)
   - Session validation
   - Permission check (Engineer/Admin only)
   - Input sanitization
   - File path validation
   - **File extension validation** (NEW)
   - File reading
   - **MIME type validation** (NEW)
   - Storage and database operations

This provides defense-in-depth security with validation at multiple layers. The backend will now properly reject invalid file types even if the frontend validation is bypassed.
