# Story 2.3: Assign Configuration Status

## Story Information

- **Epic:** 2 - Advanced Configuration Management
- **Story:** 2.3
- **Title:** Assign Configuration Status
- **Status:** Complete
- **Points:** 5
- **Assignee:** Development Agent

## Story Statement

**As an** Engineer, **I want** to assign a status to a configuration version, **so that** I and others know its state of readiness.

## Acceptance Criteria

[Source: docs/PRD.md - Epic 2, Story 2.3 - Validated]

1. In the history view, each version has a visible status (defaulting to `Draft`).
2. A user can change the status of a version to `Approved`.
3. The status is clearly displayed with a distinct color or icon.
4. Only an `Administrator` can change a status back from `Approved` to `Draft`.

```sql
-- Enhance existing configuration_versions table
ALTER TABLE configuration_versions ADD COLUMN status TEXT DEFAULT 'Draft' 
  CHECK(status IN ('Draft', 'Approved', 'Golden', 'Archived'));
ALTER TABLE configuration_versions ADD COLUMN status_changed_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id);
ALTER TABLE configuration_versions ADD COLUMN status_changed_at DATETIME;

-- Create status audit table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS configuration_status_history (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  version_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  old_status TEXT,
  new_status TEXT NOT NULL,
  changed_by INTEGER NOT NULL,
  change_reason TEXT,
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (version_id) REFERENCES configuration_versions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (changed_by) REFERENCES users(id)
);

-- Create indexes for efficient queries
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_configuration_versions_status ON configuration_versions(status);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_configuration_versions_status_asset ON configuration_versions(asset_id, status);
```
