## Project Structure Notes

Based on unified-project-structure.md requirements, the monorepo should follow the standard pattern with apps/ and packages/ directories. The Tauri application will be the primary deliverable in apps/desktop/.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Monorepo structure is created and functional
- [ ] Tauri application initializes successfully
- [ ] Application compiles without errors
- [ ] Application launches and displays blank window on target platforms
- [ ] SQLite dependency is integrated and testable
- [ ] Testing infrastructure is configured
- [ ] Development environment is documented
- [ ] Code follows established coding standards
- [ ] All acceptance criteria are met

## Testing

### Test Strategy
- **Unit Tests:** Rust backend components using built-in test framework
- **Integration Tests:** Frontend components using Vitest
- **Smoke Tests:** Application startup and basic functionality
- **Cross-Platform Tests:** Compilation and launch verification on target platforms

### Test Cases
1. **TC-1.1.1:** Verify monorepo structure creation and Turborepo configuration
2. **TC-1.1.2:** Confirm Tauri application initialization with all dependencies
3. **TC-1.1.3:** Test application compilation on Windows, macOS, and Linux
4. **TC-1.1.4:** Validate application launches and displays blank window
5. **TC-1.1.5:** Verify SQLite database integration and connection testing
6. **TC-1.1.6:** Confirm development environment setup and hot reload

### Test Data Requirements
- None (foundational setup story)

### Performance Criteria

## Dev Agent Record

### Implementation Notes
- **Primary Focus:** Follow modular monolith pattern with Turborepo
- **Critical Dependencies:** Ensure exact version matching for Tauri 2.0.0-beta
