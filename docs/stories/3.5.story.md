# Story 3.5: Complete Asset Recovery

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As an** Engineer,
**I want** to export both firmware and configuration for an asset,
**so that** I can perform complete recovery in a single operation.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A "Complete Recovery" option is available for assets with both firmware and configuration.
2. Users can select specific versions of both firmware and configuration to export.
3. The system exports both files to a user-selected location.
4. Export includes a manifest file documenting versions and checksums.
5. The entire export process maintains sub-2-second performance for configurations (firmware may take longer based on size).

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 3.4 implementation:
- Frontend tests may have JSDOM/Ant Design modal compatibility issues but production functionality works fine
- Comprehensive test coverage is essential for all scenarios
- Follow existing patterns from configuration management system
- Use proper error handling with `.map_err()` instead of `.unwrap()`

### Testing Standards

**Frontend Testing:**
- Test files location: `apps/desktop/src/**/*.test.tsx` or `*.test.ts`
- Testing framework: Vitest with React Testing Library
- Mock Tauri API calls using `vi.mock('@tauri-apps/api/core')`
- Mock dialog APIs: `vi.mock('@tauri-apps/plugin-dialog')`
- Run tests: `cd apps/desktop && npm run test`
- Coverage: `npm run test:coverage`
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#frontend-testing]

**Backend Testing:**
- Test modules: Use `#[cfg(test)]` modules within each Rust file
- Framework: Rust's built-in test framework
- Run tests: `cargo test --manifest-path apps/desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml`
- Use in-memory SQLite databases for testing repository methods
- Mock file system operations in tests

### Data Models

**Recovery Export Types:**
```typescript
interface RecoveryExportRequest {
  asset_id: number;
  config_version_id: number;
  firmware_version_id: number;
  export_directory: string;
}

interface RecoveryManifest {
  asset_id: number;
  export_date: string;
  exported_by: string;
  configuration: {
    version_id: number;
    version_number: string;
    filename: string;
    checksum: string;
    file_size: number;
  };
  firmware: {
    version_id: number;
    version: string;

  progress: number;
  message: string;
  timing?: {
    config_export_ms?: number;
    firmware_export_ms?: number;
    total_ms?: number;
  };
}
```

### API Specifications

**New Tauri Command:**
```rust
#[tauri::command]
async fn export_complete_recovery(
    app: AppHandle,
    token: String,
    asset_id: i64,
    config_version_id: i64,
    firmware_version_id: i64,
    export_directory: String,
    state: State<'_, AppState>
) -> Result<RecoveryManifest, String>
```
[Source: architecture/api-specification.md#tauri-commands]

**Existing Commands to Use:**
- `get_configurations`: To populate config version dropdown
- `get_firmware_list`: To populate firmware version dropdown
- `get_asset_by_id`: To verify asset details
- Dialog API: `open` with `directory: true` for folder selection
[Source: architecture/api-specification.md#tauri-commands]

### Component Specifications

**CompleteRecoveryModal Component:**
- Based on existing `ExportRecoveryPackageModal` pattern
- Uses Ant Design Modal with Steps component for progress
- Version selectors using Select components with search
- Shows linked versions with special indicator
- Progress tracking with performance metrics display
- Auto-close on success after 2 seconds
[Source: architecture/components.md#export-modals]

**Recovery Button Integration:**
- Add to AssetDetailPanel actions section
- Icon: `<ExportOutlined />` or `<CloudDownloadOutlined />`
- Tooltip: "Export complete recovery package"
- Disabled state when missing firmware or config
- Keyboard shortcut: Ctrl+E (Windows/Linux), Cmd+E (macOS)
[Source: architecture/components.md#asset-detail-panel]

### File Locations

**New Files to Create:**
- `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/recovery/mod.rs` - Recovery export logic
- `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/recovery/tests.rs` - Backend tests
- `apps/desktop/src/components/recovery/CompleteRecoveryModal.tsx` - Main UI
- `apps/desktop/src/components/recovery/CompleteRecoveryModal.test.tsx` - UI tests
- `apps/desktop/src/components/recovery/RecoveryProgress.tsx` - Progress display
- `apps/desktop/src/types/recovery.ts` - TypeScript types
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

**Files to Modify:**
- `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/main.rs` - Register new command
- `apps/desktop/src/components/AssetDetailPanel.tsx` - Add recovery button
- `apps/desktop/src/store/assetStore.ts` - Track recovery options
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

### Testing Requirements

**Backend Tests Required:**
- Successful export with valid configuration and firmware
- Export with missing configuration (should fail)
- Export with missing firmware (should fail)
- Invalid export directory handling
- Cleanup on export failure (partial files removed)
- Manifest generation with correct checksums
- Audit trail logging verification
- Permission checks (Engineer and Administrator only)
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#backend-testing]

**Frontend Tests Required:**
- Modal rendering with version dropdowns
- Version selection and validation
- Linked versions indicator display
- Progress state transitions
- Error message display
- Success state with auto-close
- Export button enable/disable logic
- Keyboard shortcut functionality
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#frontend-testing]

### Technical Constraints

**Performance Requirements:**
- Configuration export must complete in < 2 seconds
- Firmware export time depends on file size (show progress)
- UI must remain responsive during export
- Progress updates at least every 500ms
[Source: Epic 3.5 AC#5]

**File Naming Conventions:**
- Configuration: `{asset_name}_config_v{version}.{ext}`
- Firmware: `{asset_name}_firmware_v{version}.{ext}`
- Manifest: `{asset_name}_recovery_manifest.json`
- Sanitize asset names for filesystem compatibility
[Source: Inferred from existing export patterns]

**Export Directory Structure:**
```
selected_directory/
├── {asset_name}_config_v{version}.json
├── {asset_name}_firmware_v{version}.bin
└── {asset_name}_recovery_manifest.json
```
[Source: Inferred from existing export patterns]

### Security Considerations

- Validate export directory path to prevent directory traversal
- Require authenticated session with Engineer or Administrator role
- Sanitize filenames to prevent path injection
- Verify file integrity with SHA-256 checksums
- Audit log all export operations with user context
- Clean up partial exports on failure
- No sensitive data in manifest file
[Source: architecture/api-specification.md#security-considerations]

## Testing

**Unit Tests Required:**
- Recovery export logic with manifest generation
- Checksum calculation for both file types
- Export directory validation
- Filename sanitization
- Error handling and cleanup

**Integration Tests Required:**
- Complete export flow via Tauri command
- File system operations and permissions
- Audit trail integration
- Session validation

**Frontend Tests Required:**
- CompleteRecoveryModal with version selection
- Progress tracking through all states
- Error handling and display
- Success state with timing display
- Recovery button visibility logic

**E2E Tests Required:**
- Full user flow from asset detail to successful export
- Version selection with linked indicator
- Export cancellation handling
- Keyboard shortcut activation
- Multiple simultaneous exports
