- Dynamic forms system (from Story 5.2B)
- Asset Identity Vault and configuration management

**Technology:** 
- Frontend: React + TypeScript + Ant Design + Zustand
- Backend: Rust + Tauri + SQLite (encrypted)
- Search: Full-text search engine integration
- Database: Advanced indexing and query optimization

**Follows pattern:** Repository pattern for search operations, component-based UI for search interfaces

**Touch points:** 
- Asset management dashboard
- Asset creation/editing workflows
- Hierarchical navigation tree
- Configuration and firmware association workflows

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

1. **Full-Text Metadata Search:** Users can search across all metadata fields with relevance ranking and highlighting
2. **Advanced Filtering System:** Users can filter assets using metadata field combinations with logical operators (AND, OR, NOT)
3. **Search Results Integration:** Search results display with metadata context and direct links to asset management actions
4. **Workflow Integration:** Metadata search is seamlessly integrated into asset creation, editing, and management workflows
5. **Hierarchical Search:** Search respects asset hierarchy and can filter by organizational structure

### Integration Requirements

6. Existing asset management functionality continues to work unchanged
7. New search functionality follows existing UI patterns and design system
8. Integration with hierarchical asset system maintains current navigation behavior
9. Search performance does not impact existing asset operations
10. Metadata integration works with all asset types (folders and devices)

### Quality Requirements

12. Advanced filtering supports complex queries without performance degradation
13. Search indexing updates in real-time as metadata changes
14. All search functionality is covered by comprehensive tests
15. Search interface is accessible and follows WCAG 2.1 guidelines

## Technical Notes

## Notes

This story builds upon the solid foundation established by Stories 5.2A (metadata schema system) and 5.2B (dynamic forms) to create a comprehensive metadata search and integration system. The focus is on creating powerful search capabilities that seamlessly integrate with existing asset management workflows while maintaining the high performance and security standards established in the platform.

The implementation emphasizes offline-first functionality, encrypted data handling, and role-based access control consistent with the existing platform architecture. By building on the established patterns and technologies, this story ensures that the advanced search capabilities feel like a natural extension of the existing system rather than a bolt-on feature.

Key technical considerations include efficient database indexing strategies, real-time search index updates, and careful performance optimization to ensure that the advanced search capabilities enhance rather than hinder the user experience in managing industrial assets and configurations.
