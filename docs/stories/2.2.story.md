### Data Models
Based on existing implementation from Story 2.1 and requirements for Story 2.2:
- **Branch Model:** Already implemented in apps/desktop/src/types/branches.ts
  - Fields: id, name, description, asset_id, parent_version_id, created_by, created_at, updated_at, is_active
- **BranchInfo Model:** Already implemented with parent version relationships
  - Fields: id, name, description, asset_id, parent_version_id, parent_version_number, created_by, created_by_username, created_at, updated_at, is_active

### Database Schema
Based on existing branches table from Story 2.1 and requirements for Story 2.2:
New `branch_versions` table and schema updates required:
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS branch_versions (

  branch_version_number TEXT NOT NULL,
  is_latest BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0,
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (branch_id) REFERENCES branches(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (version_id) REFERENCES configuration_versions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  UNIQUE(branch_id, version_id),
  UNIQUE(branch_id, branch_version_number)
);

-- Enhanced branches table
ALTER TABLE branches ADD COLUMN latest_version_id INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE branches ADD COLUMN latest_branch_version TEXT;
```
