# Story: Archive Workflow Enhancement

**Story ID**: story-archive-workflow-enhancement  
**Issue Reference**: #20  
**Status**: Ready for Review  
**Agent Model Used**: claude-sonnet-4-20250514  

## Story
Enhance the "Promote to Golden" workflow to provide better version history management by implementing manual archival capabilities and improving the UI to show only active versions by default, while maintaining complete history access.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Manual Archive Functionality
- [x] Users can manually archive individual configuration versions
- [x] Archive action requires confirmation with reason (up to 500 characters)
- [x] Archived versions are removed from default version history view
- [x] Archive action is available for Silver, Approved, and Golden status versions
- [x] Only Engineers and Administrators can archive versions

### AC2: Enhanced Version History UI  
- [x] Default view shows only active versions (Draft, Silver, Approved, Golden)
- [x] Archive toggle clearly labeled to "Show Archived Versions"
- [x] Archived versions visually distinct when displayed
- [x] Version count indicators updated to reflect active vs total versions
- [x] Archive status clearly indicated in version cards

### AC3: Restore Functionality
- [x] Users can restore archived versions back to their previous active status
- [x] Restore action requires confirmation with reason
- [x] Restore maintains status change history
- [x] Appropriate permissions enforced for restore operations

### AC4: Improved Golden Promotion Impact
- [x] Golden promotion wizard shows clearer impact of archival
- [x] Promotion confirmation explains which versions will be affected
- [x] Better messaging about version lifecycle management

## Dev Notes

### Current Implementation Analysis
- Automatic archival already exists for Golden promotion
- Database schema supports Archived status with full audit trail  
- UI has archive toggle but could be enhanced
- Permission system in place for role-based actions

### Technical Approach
1. **Backend**: Add manual `archive_version` and `restore_version` commands
2. **Frontend**: Add archive/restore actions to version cards and modals
3. **UI/UX**: Enhance default view filtering and visual indicators
4. **Validation**: Ensure business rules for archive/restore operations
