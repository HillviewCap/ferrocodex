# Story 2.1: Create a Branch

## Story Information

- **Epic:** 2 - Advanced Configuration Management
- **Story:** 2.1
- **Title:** Create a Branch
- **Status:** Completed
- **Points:** 8
- **Assignee:** Development Agent

## Story Statement

As an Engineer, I want to create a branch from an existing configuration version, so that I can safely experiment with changes without affecting the main line of development.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. From the "History View" of an asset, the user can select any version.
2. An action is available to "Create Branch from this Version."
3. The user must provide a name for the new branch (e.g., "test-new-parameters").
4. The new branch appears in the UI, clearly showing its relationship to the parent version it was branched from.

## Dev Notes
