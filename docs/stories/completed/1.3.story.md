# Story 1.3: User Management

## Story Information

- **Epic:** 1 - Foundation & Core Versioning
- **Story:** 1.3
- **Title:** User Management
- **Status:** Completed
- **Points:** 5
- **Assignee:** Development Agent

## Story Statement

As an Administrator, I want to manage Engineer accounts, so that I can control who has access to the platform.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **User Management Visibility:** When logged in as an `Administrator`, a "User Management" area is visible
2. **Create Engineer Accounts:** The Administrator can create new `Engineer` user accounts (username and initial password)
3. **Deactivate/Reactivate Accounts:** The Administrator can deactivate and reactivate existing `Engineer` accounts
4. **Role-Based Access Control:** `Engineer` users do not see the "User Management" area

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.2 completion, the authentication foundation is available:
- User authentication system with bcrypt password hashing is functional
- SQLite database with user accounts is operational
- User roles (Administrator, Engineer) are defined and implemented
- Login/authentication flow with session management is working
- Dashboard screen exists as the entry point after login
- Zustand state management is configured for authentication state
- Role-based access control patterns are established
