# Story 5.1: Hierarchical Asset Creation

## Story Information

- **Epic:** 5 - Asset-Centric Hierarchical Management
- **Story:** 5.1
- **Title:** Hierarchical Asset Creation
- **Status:** done
- **Points:** 13
- **Assignee:** Development Agent

## Story Statement

As an Engineer, I want to create asset folders and individual device records in a hierarchical structure, so that I can organize my industrial environment logically (e.g., "Production Line 1" → "PLC-001", "HMI-002").

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Users can create "folder" type assets that act as containers
2. Users can create "device" type assets within folders or at root level
3. Folders can be nested to unlimited depth
4. Clear visual distinction between folders and devices in UI
5. Drag-and-drop organization between folders
