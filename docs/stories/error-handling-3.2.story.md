# Story EH-3.2: Graceful Degradation and Fallback Systems

## Story Information

- **Epic:** Error Handling Enhancement
- **Story:** EH-3.2
- **Title:** Graceful Degradation and Fallback Systems
- **Status:** To Do
- **Points:** 9
- **Assignee:** Development Agent

## Story Statement

As an operations engineer, I want the system to continue functioning with reduced capability when components fail, so that critical OT operations can continue even with partial system failures.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Fallback Service Providers:** Fallback service providers for critical operations (offline mode, cached data)
2. **Feature Disabling:** Feature disabling with clear user notification when services unavailable
3. **Cached Data Utilization:** Cached data utilization when primary data sources fail
4. **User Preference Settings:** User preference settings for degradation behavior
5. **Degraded Mode Indication:** Clear indication of degraded functionality in user interface

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This story builds upon the automatic retry system (EH-3.1) to implement graceful degradation when automatic recovery fails, ensuring OT operations continuity.

### Technical Framework Integration
[Source: CLAUDE.md and existing codebase analysis]
- **Service Layer:** Implement fallback logic in existing service and repository layers
- **Caching System:** Extend existing data caching for offline operation support
- **Feature Flags:** Create feature availability system integrated with existing architecture
- **UI State Management:** Extend Zustand store with degradation state tracking

### Architecture Pattern Integration
[Source: Ferrocodex architecture and error handling PRD]
- **Degradation Module:** Create graceful degradation utilities in `error_handling/` module
- **Cache Integration:** Utilize existing SQLite database for offline data caching
- **Service Abstraction:** Create service provider abstraction for fallback implementation
- **UI Indicators:** Integrate degradation indicators with existing status displays

### OT Environment Requirements
Based on industrial operations continuity needs:
- **Critical Operations:** Asset management, configuration access, and audit logging must remain available
- **Offline Capability:** Essential data must be cached for offline operation
- **Safety Considerations:** Degraded operations must maintain safety boundaries
- **User Awareness:** Clear indication of reduced capabilities for operational safety

### Fallback Strategy Design
[Source: Error Handling PRD recovery requirements]
- **Service Hierarchy:** Primary → Secondary → Cached → Offline modes
- **Data Freshness:** Cache timestamping and staleness indicators
- **Feature Matrix:** Critical vs. non-critical feature classification
- **Recovery Detection:** Automatic service restoration when components recover

## Notes

This story implements Level 2 recovery mechanisms that ensure Ferrocodex remains operational even when primary services fail. The graceful degradation system is critical for OT environments where operational continuity is paramount. By providing fallback services, cached data access, and clear degradation indicators, the system maintains essential functionality while keeping users informed about reduced capabilities. The user preference system ensures that degradation behavior aligns with organizational policies and operational requirements.
