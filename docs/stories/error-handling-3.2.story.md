# Story EH-3.2: Graceful Degradation and Fallback Systems

## Story Information

- **Epic:** Error Handling Enhancement
- **Story:** EH-3.2
- **Title:** Graceful Degradation and Fallback Systems
- **Status:** Done
- **Points:** 9
- **Assignee:** Development Agent

## Story Statement

As an operations engineer, I want the system to continue functioning with reduced capability when components fail, so that critical OT operations can continue even with partial system failures.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Fallback Service Providers:** Fallback service providers for critical operations (offline mode, cached data)
2. **Feature Disabling:** Feature disabling with clear user notification when services unavailable
3. **Cached Data Utilization:** Cached data utilization when primary data sources fail
4. **User Preference Settings:** User preference settings for degradation behavior
5. **Degraded Mode Indication:** Clear indication of degraded functionality in user interface

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This story builds upon the automatic retry system (EH-3.1) to implement graceful degradation when automatic recovery fails, ensuring OT operations continuity.

### Technical Framework Integration
[Source: CLAUDE.md and existing codebase analysis]
- **Service Layer:** Implement fallback logic in existing service and repository layers
- **Caching System:** Extend existing data caching for offline operation support
- **Feature Flags:** Create feature availability system integrated with existing architecture
- **UI State Management:** Extend Zustand store with degradation state tracking

### Architecture Pattern Integration
[Source: Ferrocodex architecture and error handling PRD]
- **Degradation Module:** Create graceful degradation utilities in `error_handling/` module
- **Cache Integration:** Utilize existing SQLite database for offline data caching
- **Service Abstraction:** Create service provider abstraction for fallback implementation
- **UI Indicators:** Integrate degradation indicators with existing status displays

### OT Environment Requirements
Based on industrial operations continuity needs:
- **Critical Operations:** Asset management, configuration access, and audit logging must remain available
