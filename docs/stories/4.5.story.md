# Story 4.5: Secure Credential Sharing

## Story Information

- **Epic:** 4 - Asset Identity Vault
- **Story:** 4.5
- **Title:** Secure Credential Sharing
- **Status:** Draft
- **Points:** 4
- **Assignee:** Development Agent

## Story Statement

As an Administrator, I want to control which users can access identity vault information, so that I can enable secure sharing of credentials among authorized team members while maintaining security controls.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Role-Based Access Control:** Identity vault access is controlled by the existing role-based permission system.
2. **Granular Permissions:** Administrators can grant or revoke access to specific identity vaults for individual Engineer users.
3. **Audit Trail Integration:** All access to identity vault information is logged in the audit trail.
4. **Selective Access:** Users can only view credentials for vaults they have been explicitly granted access to.
5. **Time-Limited Access:** The system supports time-limited access grants that automatically expire after a specified period.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Dependencies
This story builds upon all previous Epic 4 stories (4.1-4.4) and extends the existing role-based permission system established in Epic 1. It requires vault infrastructure, credential management, and export functionality to be in place.

### Technical Framework Integration
[Source: existing authentication and authorization system]
- **Permission System Extension:** Extend existing role-based permissions to include vault-specific access control
- **Time-Based Access:** Implement time-limited permission grants with automatic expiration
- **Audit Integration:** Leverage existing audit trail system for vault access logging
- **Session Management:** Integrate with existing session management for access validation

### Architecture Pattern Integration
[Source: existing user management and security systems]
- **Permission Repository:** Extend existing UserRepository with vault permission management
- **Access Control Service:** Create VaultAccessControlService following existing security patterns
- **Audit Service Integration:** Extend existing audit logging for vault access events
- **Session Validation:** Integrate vault permissions with existing session validation

### Permission Model Design
Based on existing user management system and vault security requirements:
- **Vault Permissions:** Create granular permissions per vault (read, write, export, share)
- **Time-Limited Grants:** Support expiration timestamps for temporary access
- **Permission Inheritance:** Administrators have full access, Engineers require explicit grants
- **Access Levels:** Different permission levels (view-only, full-access, export-enabled)

### Security Requirements
[Source: NFR7 and existing security implementation]
- All vault access must be validated against current permissions before data retrieval
- Permission changes must be logged with full audit trail
- Time-limited access must be enforced at the database and API level
- Access validation must occur on every vault operation

### UI/UX Integration
[Source: existing user management interface]
- Extend existing user management interface with vault permission controls
- Add vault access indicators to asset detail views
- Implement permission request/approval workflow for enhanced usability
- Create vault access status indicators in the main dashboard
