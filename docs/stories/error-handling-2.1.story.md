# Story EH-2.1: Request ID Tracking and Correlation System

## Story Information

- **Epic:** Error Handling Enhancement
- **Story:** EH-2.1
- **Title:** Request ID Tracking and Correlation System
- **Status:** Done
- **Points:** 6
- **Assignee:** Development Agent

## Story Statement

As a system administrator, I want to track operations end-to-end with unique request IDs, so that I can correlate errors across different system layers and diagnose complex issues.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Request ID Generation:** Unique request IDs generated for all user-initiated operations
2. **Cross-Layer Propagation:** Request IDs propagated through all system layers (Frontend → Tauri → Backend → Database)  
3. **Error Correlation:** Error context includes request ID for correlation across system components
4. **Audit Integration:** Audit logging enhanced with request ID correlation for complete traceability
5. **Admin Visibility:** Request ID visible in admin error details for debugging and issue tracking

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This story builds upon Stories EH-1.1 and EH-1.2, adding request correlation capabilities to the enhanced error type system and conversion layer.

### Technical Framework Integration
[Source: CLAUDE.md and existing codebase analysis]
- **Request ID Flow:** Frontend generates UUID → Tauri commands → Backend operations → Database logging
- **Existing Integration:** Leverage existing audit logging system for request correlation
- **State Management:** Integrate with existing Zustand store for request tracking
- **Database Integration:** Extend existing audit tables with request ID correlation

### Architecture Pattern Integration
[Source: Ferrocodex architecture and error handling PRD]
- **Correlation Module:** Create request correlation utilities in `error_handling/` module
- **Frontend Integration:** Add request ID generation to existing operation flows
- **Backend Tracking:** Integrate request ID tracking with existing repository pattern
- **Audit Enhancement:** Extend existing audit logging with correlation data

### Request Correlation Requirements
Based on existing audit patterns and correlation needs:
- **UUID Generation:** Use UUID v4 for unique request identification
- **Propagation Chain:** Frontend → Tauri IPC → Backend services → Database operations
- **Correlation Storage:** Extend existing audit tables with request_id column
- **Cross-Reference:** Enable correlation between related operations and errors

### Performance and Storage Considerations
[Source: Error Handling PRD performance constraints]
- Request ID generation must be lightweight (<1ms)
- Correlation tracking must not impact existing operation performance
- Database storage optimization for request correlation queries
- Memory usage for request tracking must be minimal

## Notes

This story enables powerful diagnostic capabilities by providing end-to-end request tracking throughout the Ferrocodex system. The request correlation system will allow administrators to trace complex issues across multiple system layers, significantly improving debugging efficiency and system observability. The implementation builds on the enhanced error type system from Phase 1 while preparing for the advanced recovery mechanisms in Phase 3.
