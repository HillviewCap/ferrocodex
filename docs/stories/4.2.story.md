# Story 4.2: Individual Asset Password Management

## Story Information

- **Epic:** 4 - Asset Identity Vault
- **Story:** 4.2
- **Title:** Individual Asset Password Management
- **Status:** Draft
- **Points:** 5
- **Assignee:** Development Agent

## Story Statement

As an Engineer, I want to store and manage unique passwords for individual assets, so that I can eliminate password reuse and maintain strong, unique credentials for every device.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Multiple Credential Entries:** Each asset's identity vault supports multiple credential entries with descriptive labels (e.g., "Admin Login", "Maintenance Account", "Read-Only Access").
2. **Password Generation:** The system can generate strong, unique passwords automatically when requested.
3. **Password Strength Indicators:** Password strength indicators are displayed when creating or updating credentials.
4. **Password History Tracking:** Users can view password history to track when credentials were last changed.
5. **Password Reuse Prevention:** The system warns users if they attempt to reuse passwords across different assets or accounts.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Dependencies
This story builds directly upon Story 4.1: PLC Identity Vault Creation. It requires the vault infrastructure to be in place and extends it with advanced password management capabilities.

### Technical Framework Integration
[Source: Story 4.1 implementation and architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Password Generation:** Integrate Rust-based secure random password generation using `rand` crate
- **Password Strength Validation:** Implement frontend password strength meter using established UI patterns
- **Database Extension:** Extend vault_secrets table with password-specific metadata (strength_score, last_changed, previous_hashes)
- **Frontend Components:** Create password-specific UI components following existing form patterns

### Architecture Pattern Integration
[Source: existing authentication system and Story 4.1]
- **Password Hashing:** Utilize existing bcrypt infrastructure for password verification and history tracking
- **Secure Storage:** Extend existing AES-256 encryption for password storage
- **Validation Layer:** Add password policy validation following existing input validation patterns
- **Component Reuse:** Leverage existing form components and validation patterns

### Password Security Requirements
[Source: NFR7 from PRD and security best practices]
- Password generation must use cryptographically secure random number generation
- Password strength must be calculated using industry-standard algorithms (entropy, character set diversity)
- Password history must be stored as bcrypt hashes for reuse detection without exposing plaintext
- All password operations must maintain audit trail compliance

### Password Policy Implementation
Based on industrial security requirements:
- **Minimum Length:** 12 characters for generated passwords
- **Character Set:** Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- **Entropy Target:** Minimum 60 bits of entropy for generated passwords
- **Reuse Prevention:** Check against last 5 password hashes for each credential

### UI/UX Requirements
[Source: UI design goals from PRD]
- Password strength indicator must be visually clear and non-technical
- Password generation must be one-click with option to regenerate
- Password reuse warnings must be prominent but not blocking
- Password history must be presented as timeline following existing patterns
