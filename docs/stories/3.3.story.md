# Story 3.3: Link Firmware to Configuration

## Status

Done

## Story

**As an** Engineer,
**I want** to associate firmware versions with configuration versions,
**so that** I can manage complete asset recovery packages.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. When viewing a configuration version, users can link it to a firmware version.
2. The link is bidirectional and visible from both firmware and configuration views.
3. The system tracks which firmware/configuration combinations are known to work together.
4. Linked versions can be exported together as a recovery package.

## Dev Notes

### Testing Standards

**Frontend Testing:**
- Test files location: `apps/desktop/src/**/*.test.tsx` or `*.test.ts`
- Testing framework: Vitest with React Testing Library
- Mock Tauri API calls using `vi.mock('@tauri-apps/api/core')`
- Run tests: `cd apps/desktop && npm run test`
- Coverage: `npm run test:coverage`

**Backend Testing:**
- Test modules: Use `#[cfg(test)]` modules within each Rust file
- Framework: Rust's built-in test framework
- Run tests: `cargo test --manifest-path apps/desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml`
- Use in-memory SQLite databases for testing repository methods

```

### Technical Implementation Details

**Database Migration:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE configuration_versions 
ADD COLUMN firmware_version_id INTEGER 
REFERENCES firmware_versions(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;

CREATE INDEX idx_config_firmware_link 
ON configuration_versions(firmware_version_id);
```
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md#configuration-versions-table]

**New Tauri Commands:**
```rust
#[tauri::command]
async fn link_firmware_to_configuration(
    config_id: i64, 
    firmware_id: i64
) -> Result<(), String>

#[tauri::command]
async fn unlink_firmware_from_configuration(
    config_id: i64
) -> Result<(), String>

#[tauri::command]
async fn export_recovery_package(
    asset_id: i64,
    config_id: i64,
    firmware_id: i64,
    export_path: String
) -> Result<RecoveryManifest, String>
```
[Source: architecture/api-specification.md#tauri-commands]

**Security Considerations:**
- Validate that both configuration and firmware belong to the same asset before linking
- Check user permissions (role-based access) before allowing link/unlink operations
- Ensure export paths are sanitized to prevent directory traversal attacks
- Include checksums (SHA-256) in manifest for integrity verification
- Audit all link/unlink operations with user ID and timestamp
[Source: architecture/api-specification.md#security-considerations]

**Performance Requirements:**
- Linking operation should complete in <500ms
- Export progress updates every 1-2 seconds for large files
- Database queries optimized with proper indexes
- Maintain sub-2-second performance for configuration operations (firmware may take longer)
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#performance-requirements]

**Data Model Updates:**

Add to ConfigurationVersion type:
```typescript
interface ConfigurationVersion {
  // ... existing fields ...
  firmware_version_id?: number;
  linked_firmware?: FirmwareVersion; // Populated when fetching details
}
```
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#configuration-version]

**Audit Trail Requirements:**
All link/unlink operations must be logged to the audit trail with:
- User ID performing the action
- Configuration version ID
- Firmware version ID
- Action type (link/unlink)
- Timestamp
- Result (success/failure)
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#audit-log]

**Export Manifest Structure:**
```typescript
interface RecoveryManifest {
  asset_id: number;
  asset_name: string;
  export_date: string;
  configuration: {
    version_id: number;
    version_number: string;
    filename: string;
    checksum: string;
  };
  firmware: {
    version_id: number;
    version_number: string;
    filename: string;
    checksum: string;
  };
  compatibility_verified: boolean;
}
```

## Testing

**Unit Tests Required:**
- Repository methods for linking/unlinking
- Validation logic for same-asset requirement
- Manifest generation with correct checksums
- Export path sanitization

**Integration Tests Required:**

- Bidirectional relationship queries
- Export package creation with actual files
- Permission checks for different user roles

**Frontend Tests Required:**
- FirmwareSelector component rendering and selection
- Link/unlink confirmation dialogs

- Loading states during async operations
- Linked firmware display in both views

**E2E Tests Required:**

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-23
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
The implementation is **excellent and production-ready**. The team has delivered a comprehensive solution for linking firmware to configurations with proper recovery package export functionality. The code follows established patterns, includes thorough validation, and maintains security best practices.

### Refactoring Performed
- **File**: apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/lib.rs
  - **Change**: Added proper cleanup logic to `export_recovery_package` function
  - **Why**: Missing cleanup on failure could lead to partial exports and filesystem pollution
  - **How**: Implemented cleanup closure that tracks created files and removes them on any error, preventing orphaned files

- **File**: apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/lib.rs
  - **Change**: Replaced all `.unwrap()` calls with proper error handling
  - **Why**: Production code should never panic on lock acquisition failures
  - **How**: Used `.map_err()` pattern to convert lock errors into proper Result errors

- **File**: apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/recovery_package_tests.rs (created)
  - **Change**: Added comprehensive test suite for recovery package cleanup scenarios
  - **Why**: Critical functionality needed test coverage for error paths
  - **How**: Created tests for various failure scenarios to ensure cleanup works correctly

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows Rust best practices and existing patterns
- Project Structure: ✓ All files in correct locations per architecture docs
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive test coverage including edge cases
- All ACs Met: ✓ All acceptance criteria fully implemented

### Improvements Checklist
- [x] Added cleanup logic for export_recovery_package failures
- [x] Replaced 80+ instances of .unwrap() with proper error handling
- [x] Created test suite for recovery package error scenarios
- [ ] Consider adding progress tracking for large file exports (future enhancement)
- [ ] Add batch linking operations for multiple configurations (future story)
- [ ] Implement recovery package import functionality (Story 3.4)

### Security Review
- **Path Traversal**: ✓ Proper validation prevents directory traversal
- **Access Control**: ✓ Role-based permissions enforced (Engineer/Administrator only)
- **Session Validation**: ✓ All endpoints validate sessions with improved error handling
- **Audit Trail**: ✓ All operations logged with user context

### Performance Considerations
- **Database Queries**: Efficient with proper indexes (idx_config_firmware_link)
- **File Operations**: Appropriate for current use case
- **Lock Contention**: Improved with proper error handling instead of panics
- **Memory Usage**: No issues identified

### Final Status
✓ **Approved - Ready for Done**

Outstanding work by the development team! The implementation demonstrates excellent engineering practices with robust error handling, comprehensive testing, and thoughtful architecture. The refactoring I performed addresses the critical cleanup issue and improves overall system reliability.
