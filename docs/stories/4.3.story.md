# Story 4.3: Standalone IT Asset Credential Storage

## Story Information

- **Epic:** 4 - Asset Identity Vault
- **Story:** 4.3
- **Title:** Standalone IT Asset Credential Storage
- **Status:** Draft
- **Points:** 4
- **Assignee:** Development Agent

## Story Statement

As an Engineer, I want to store passwords for jump hosts, databases, and other IT assets that aren't tracked as PLCs on the platform, so that I can manage all my industrial environment credentials in one secure location.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Standalone Credential Creation:** Users can create standalone credential entries that are not associated with a tracked PLC asset.
2. **Multi-Type Support:** Standalone entries support the same credential types as PLC vaults (passwords, IP addresses, VPN keys, license files).
3. **Category Organization:** Standalone credentials can be organized into categories (e.g., "Jump Hosts", "Databases", "Network Equipment").
4. **Search and Filtering:** Search and filtering capabilities help users quickly locate specific standalone credentials.
5. **Consistent Security:** The same encryption, versioning, and audit trail features apply to standalone credentials.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Dependencies
This story builds upon Stories 4.1 (PLC Identity Vault Creation) and 4.2 (Individual Asset Password Management). It extends the vault system to support credentials that exist independently of tracked PLC assets.

### Technical Framework Integration
[Source: Stories 4.1 and 4.2 implementation, architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Database Extension:** Create new tables for standalone credentials separate from asset-associated vaults
- **Category Management:** Implement hierarchical category system for credential organization
- **Search Infrastructure:** Extend existing search patterns with full-text search for credential metadata
- **UI Pattern Reuse:** Leverage existing vault UI components for consistent user experience

### Architecture Pattern Integration
[Source: existing asset management and vault systems]
- **Repository Pattern:** Create StandaloneCredentialRepository following existing vault patterns
- **Search Service:** Implement credential search service using existing search infrastructure
- **Category Management:** Add category management following existing hierarchical data patterns
- **Component Reuse:** Extend existing vault components for standalone credential management

### Database Schema Requirements
Based on standalone credential requirements and existing vault patterns:
- **standalone_credentials table:** Primary credential storage independent of assets
- **credential_categories table:** Hierarchical category system for organization
- **credential_tags table:** Flexible tagging system for additional organization
- **standalone_credential_history table:** Version history and audit trail for standalone credentials

### Search and Filtering Requirements
[Source: UX design goals and performance requirements]
- Full-text search across credential names, descriptions, and categories
- Filter by credential type, category, creation date, and last accessed
- Search results must return in under 1 second
- Advanced filtering with multiple criteria combinations

### Category System Design
Based on industrial environment organizational needs:
- **Hierarchical Categories:** Support nested categories (e.g., Network > Switches > Building A)
- **Predefined Categories:** Common categories like "Jump Hosts", "Databases", "Network Equipment"
- **Custom Categories:** Users can create custom categories as needed
- **Category-based Permissions:** Future support for category-based access control
