## Story Information

- **Epic:** Error Handling Enhancement
- **Story:** EH-3.1
- **Title:** Automatic Retry and Circuit Breaker Implementation
- **Status:** To Do
- **Points:** 8
- **Assignee:** Development Agent

## Story Statement

As a system user, I want the system to automatically recover from transient errors, so that temporary issues don't interrupt my workflow.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Exponential Backoff Retry:** Exponential backoff retry mechanism for transient errors with configurable limits
2. **Circuit Breaker Pattern:** Circuit breaker pattern prevents cascading failures for external services
3. **User Configuration:** User-configurable retry limits and thresholds through existing settings system
4. **Visual Progress:** Visual progress indicators during automatic recovery attempts
5. **Manual Fallback:** Fallback to manual recovery when automatic attempts fail

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This story builds upon the enhanced error classification system (EH-1.1, EH-1.2) and frontend integration (EH-2.1, EH-2.2) to implement intelligent automatic recovery mechanisms.

### Technical Framework Integration
[Source: CLAUDE.md and existing codebase analysis]
- **Rust Backend:** Implement retry and circuit breaker logic in backend services
- **Async Operations:** Integrate with existing async operation patterns in Tauri commands
- **Configuration:** Utilize existing user settings system for retry configuration
- **UI Integration:** Add recovery progress indicators to existing interface

### Architecture Pattern Integration
[Source: Ferrocodex architecture and error handling PRD]
- **Recovery Module:** Create recovery utilities in `error_handling/` module
- **Service Integration:** Integrate with existing repository and service layers
- **State Management:** Track recovery state in existing Zustand store
- **Configuration Storage:** Use existing SQLite user settings for retry preferences

### Retry Strategy Requirements
Based on OT environment reliability needs and existing patterns:
- **Transient Detection:** Identify transient vs. permanent errors for appropriate retry
- **Exponential Backoff:** Implement exponential backoff with jitter to prevent thundering herd
- **Timeout Handling:** Configurable timeouts for retry operations
- **Resource Protection:** Circuit breaker prevents resource exhaustion

### Circuit Breaker Design
[Source: Error Handling PRD recovery requirements]
- **State Machine:** Closed, Open, Half-Open states for service health tracking
- **Failure Threshold:** Configurable failure threshold for circuit opening
- **Recovery Testing:** Half-open state for testing service recovery
- **Reset Timer:** Automatic circuit reset after configurable time period

## Notes

This story implements the first level of intelligent recovery mechanisms, significantly improving system reliability by automatically handling transient errors. The exponential backoff retry system and circuit breaker pattern protect both the application and external services from cascading failures while providing users with visibility into recovery attempts. The implementation maintains user control through configuration options and manual fallback capabilities, ensuring that automatic recovery enhances rather than replaces user agency in error resolution.
