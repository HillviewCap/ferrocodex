## Notes

This story implements the first level of intelligent recovery mechanisms, significantly improving system reliability by automatically handling transient errors. The exponential backoff retry system and circuit breaker pattern protect both the application and external services from cascading failures while providing users with visibility into recovery attempts. The implementation maintains user control through configuration options and manual fallback capabilities, ensuring that automatic recovery enhances rather than replaces user agency in error resolution.
