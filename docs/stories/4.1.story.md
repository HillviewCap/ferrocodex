# Story 4.1: PLC Identity Vault Creation

## Story Information

- **Epic:** 4 - Asset Identity Vault
- **Story:** 4.1
- **Title:** PLC Identity Vault Creation
- **Status:** Draft
- **Points:** 5
- **Assignee:** Development Agent

## Story Statement

As an Engineer, I want to create an identity vault for a PLC that groups all its secrets together, so that I have a single, secure location for all authentication information related to that asset.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Identity Vault Creation:** From an asset's detail view, users can create an "Identity Vault" that stores multiple types of secrets for that PLC.
2. **Multi-Secret Storage:** The vault can store login passwords, IP addresses, VPN keys, and license files in a single, organized container.
3. **Encryption Standard:** All vault contents are encrypted using the same AES-256 standard as configuration files.
4. **Version History:** The vault maintains version history and audit trails for all changes to any secret within it.
5. **Recovery Integration:** Vault creation is integrated with the existing asset recovery export functionality.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This story builds upon the existing asset management system established in Epic 1 and Epic 2. The identity vault system extends the current asset detail views and integrates with the existing encryption and audit trail systems.

### Technical Framework Integration
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md and existing codebase analysis]
- **Database Layer:** Extend existing SQLite schema with identity vault tables
- **Encryption:** Utilize existing AES-256 encryption infrastructure from configuration file encryption
- **Frontend Integration:** Extend existing React asset detail components with new vault management interface
- **State Management:** Integrate with existing Zustand store for asset management
- **Audit Trail:** Leverage existing audit logging system for vault operations

### Architecture Pattern Integration
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md and existing implementation]
- **Repository Pattern:** Create new `VaultRepository` following existing patterns in `src-tauri/src/assets/repository.rs`
- **Tauri IPC Commands:** Add new commands for vault operations in `src-tauri/src/main.rs`
- **Component Structure:** Follow existing component patterns in `src/components/` for vault UI components

### Database Schema Requirements
Based on existing database patterns and identity vault requirements:
- **vault_entries table:** Store vault metadata (vault_id, asset_id, created_by, created_at, updated_at)
- **vault_secrets table:** Store individual secrets within vaults (secret_id, vault_id, secret_type, label, encrypted_value, version, audit_trail)
- **vault_versions table:** Track version history for vault changes (version_id, vault_id, change_type, author, timestamp, notes)

### Security Requirements
[Source: NFR2 from PRD and existing encryption implementation]
- All vault contents must be encrypted using AES-256 before storage
- Secrets must be encrypted individually to allow granular access
- Encryption keys must follow existing key management patterns
- Audit trail must track all vault access and modifications

### UI Integration Points
[Source: existing asset detail view implementation]
- Extend existing asset detail view with new "Identity Vault" tab
- Follow existing design patterns from configuration and firmware tabs
- Integrate with existing status indicators and action buttons
- Maintain consistency with existing Ant Design component usage

### Performance Requirements
[Source: NFR3 from PRD]
- Vault creation and access operations must complete in under 2 seconds
- Large license file storage must not impact UI responsiveness
- Encryption/decryption operations must be optimized for user experience
