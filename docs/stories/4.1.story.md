# Story 4.1: PLC Identity Vault Creation

## Story Information

- **Epic:** 4 - Asset Identity Vault
- **Story:** 4.1
- **Title:** PLC Identity Vault Creation
- **Status:** Ready
- **Points:** 5
- **Assignee:** Development Agent

## Story Statement

As an Engineer, I want to create an identity vault for a PLC that groups all its secrets together, so that I have a single, secure location for all authentication information related to that asset.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Identity Vault Creation:** From an asset's detail view, users can create an "Identity Vault" that stores multiple types of secrets for that PLC.
2. **Multi-Secret Storage:** The vault can store login passwords, IP addresses, VPN keys, and license files in a single, organized container.
3. **Encryption Standard:** All vault contents are encrypted using the same AES-256 standard as configuration files.
4. **Version History:** The vault maintains version history and audit trails for all changes to any secret within it.
5. **Recovery Integration:** Vault creation is integrated with the existing asset recovery export functionality.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This story builds upon the existing asset management system established in Epic 1 and Epic 2. The identity vault system extends the current asset detail views and integrates with the existing encryption and audit trail systems.

### Technical Framework Integration
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md and existing codebase analysis]
- **Database Layer:** Extend existing SQLite schema with identity vault tables
- **Encryption:** Utilize existing AES-256 encryption infrastructure from configuration file encryption
- **Frontend Integration:** Extend existing React asset detail components with new vault management interface
- **State Management:** Integrate with existing Zustand store for asset management
- **Audit Trail:** Leverage existing audit logging system for vault operations

### Architecture Pattern Integration
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md and existing implementation]
- **Repository Pattern:** Create new `VaultRepository` following existing patterns in `src-tauri/src/assets/repository.rs`
- **Tauri IPC Commands:** Add new commands for vault operations in `src-tauri/src/main.rs`
- **Component Structure:** Follow existing component patterns in `src/components/` for vault UI components

### Database Schema Requirements
Based on existing database patterns and identity vault requirements:
- **vault_entries table:** Store vault metadata (vault_id, asset_id, created_by, created_at, updated_at)
- **vault_secrets table:** Store individual secrets within vaults (secret_id, vault_id, secret_type, label, encrypted_value, version, audit_trail)
- **vault_versions table:** Track version history for vault changes (version_id, vault_id, change_type, author, timestamp, notes)

### Security Requirements
[Source: NFR2 from PRD and existing encryption implementation]
- All vault contents must be encrypted using AES-256 before storage
- Secrets must be encrypted individually to allow granular access
- Encryption keys must follow existing key management patterns
- Audit trail must track all vault access and modifications

### UI Integration Points
[Source: existing asset detail view implementation]
- Extend existing asset detail view with new "Identity Vault" tab
- Follow existing design patterns from configuration and firmware tabs
- Integrate with existing status indicators and action buttons
- Maintain consistency with existing Ant Design component usage

### Performance Requirements
[Source: NFR3 from PRD]
- Vault creation and access operations must complete in under 2 seconds
- Large license file storage must not impact UI responsiveness
- Encryption/decryption operations must be optimized for user experience

The core vault functionality with proper AES-256 encryption and complete recovery integration makes this production-ready, with remaining items being enhancements rather than blockers.

## Notes

This story establishes the foundation for the Asset Identity Vault system by creating the core vault functionality for PLCs. It integrates with existing asset management, encryption, and audit systems while maintaining the established architectural patterns. The story focuses on creating a secure, organized container for all PLC-related authentication information, supporting the broader goal of eliminating cognitive burden on engineers and enabling secure credential management.
