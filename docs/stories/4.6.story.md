# Story 4.6: Password Rotation Workflow

## Story Information

- **Epic:** 4 - Asset Identity Vault
- **Story:** 4.6
- **Title:** Password Rotation Workflow
- **Status:** Draft
- **Points:** 5
- **Assignee:** Development Agent

## Story Statement

As an Engineer, I want to easily rotate passwords and track the rotation history, so that I can maintain security best practices and respond quickly to security incidents.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Guided Rotation Process:** Each credential entry has a "Rotate Password" action that guides users through the password change process.
2. **Rotation Scheduling:** The system tracks password rotation dates and can alert users when passwords are approaching recommended rotation intervals.
3. **Historical Archive:** Previous passwords are securely archived in the version history but marked as "Rotated" to prevent accidental reuse.
4. **Rotation Documentation:** Users can add notes during password rotation to document the reason for the change.
5. **Batch Rotation:** Batch rotation workflows allow users to rotate multiple related passwords (e.g., all accounts on a specific PLC) in a coordinated manner.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Dependencies
This story builds upon all previous Epic 4 stories, particularly Story 4.2 (Individual Asset Password Management) for password history tracking and Story 4.5 (Secure Credential Sharing) for access control integration.

### Technical Framework Integration
[Source: existing password management system and audit infrastructure]
- **Rotation Service:** Create PasswordRotationService building on existing password management
- **Scheduling System:** Implement rotation schedule tracking with configurable intervals
- **Batch Operations:** Extend existing bulk operations patterns for coordinated password rotation
- **Notification System:** Integrate with existing audit system for rotation alerts and reminders

### Architecture Pattern Integration
[Source: existing password and vault management systems]
- **Workflow Service:** Create rotation workflow service following existing wizard patterns
- **Scheduler Integration:** Add rotation scheduling to existing background task patterns
- **Batch Processing:** Implement coordinated rotation using existing bulk operation infrastructure
- **History Management:** Extend existing password history with rotation-specific metadata

### Rotation Workflow Design
Based on security best practices and existing UI patterns:
- **Rotation Wizard:** Multi-step guided process similar to existing "Promote to Golden" workflow
- **Batch Selection:** Interface for selecting related credentials for coordinated rotation
- **Rotation Scheduling:** Configurable intervals (30, 60, 90 days) with custom options
- **Emergency Rotation:** Immediate rotation workflow for security incidents

### Security Requirements
[Source: password security requirements and audit compliance]
- Rotated passwords must be immediately marked as inactive in all systems
- Rotation events must be comprehensively logged with full audit trail
- Batch rotations must maintain transactional integrity
- Historical passwords must remain encrypted and access-controlled

### Performance and Usability Requirements
[Source: NFR3 and UX design goals]
- Individual password rotation must complete in under 2 seconds
- Batch rotation progress must be displayed with cancellation support
- Rotation scheduling must not impact system performance
- Rotation alerts must be non-intrusive but persistent until addressed
