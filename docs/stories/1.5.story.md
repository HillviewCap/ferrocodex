# Story 1.5: View Configuration History

## Story Information

- **Epic:** 1 - Foundation & Core Versioning
- **Story:** 1.5
- **Title:** View Configuration History
- **Status:** Completed
- **Points:** 5
- **Assignee:** Development Agent

## Story Statement

As an Engineer, I want to view the complete version history of an asset, so that I have a full audit trail of all changes.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Clicking on an asset from the dashboard navigates to a "History View."
2. The History View displays a list of all saved versions in reverse chronological order.
3. Each entry in the list clearly shows the version number, author, timestamp, and the user's notes for that change.
4. The view is performant and loads in under 2 seconds.

## Dev Notes

## Notes

This story builds upon the solid foundation established in Story 1.4, leveraging the existing asset management system, data models, and backend infrastructure. The implementation focuses on creating an intuitive history view that provides engineers with complete audit trail visibility while maintaining the performance and accessibility standards established in previous stories.

The story utilizes the existing `get_configuration_versions` IPC command and asset store functionality, requiring primarily frontend development to create the user interface components and navigation logic. The backend infrastructure is already complete and tested from Story 1.4.
