# Story 4.4: Integrated Recovery Bundle Export

## Story Information

- **Epic:** 4 - Asset Identity Vault
- **Story:** 4.4
- **Title:** Integrated Recovery Bundle Export
- **Status:** Draft
- **Points:** 3
- **Assignee:** Development Agent

## Story Statement

As an Engineer, I want to export a complete recovery bundle that includes configuration, firmware, and identity vault information, so that I have everything needed for complete asset recovery in a single, secure package.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Enhanced Export Functionality:** The existing recovery export functionality is enhanced to include identity vault contents.
2. **Optional Vault Inclusion:** Users can choose to include or exclude identity vault information in recovery bundles based on security policies.
3. **Encryption Consistency:** When identity vault information is included, it maintains the same encryption standards during export.
4. **Complete Manifest:** The recovery bundle manifest documents all included components (configuration, firmware, credentials).
5. **Full Import Support:** Import functionality can restore the complete bundle including identity vault information to a new installation.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Dependencies
This story builds upon Stories 4.1 (PLC Identity Vault Creation), 4.2 (Individual Asset Password Management), and 4.3 (Standalone IT Asset Credential Storage). It also integrates with existing recovery export functionality from Epic 2 and Epic 3.

### Technical Framework Integration
[Source: existing recovery export system and vault infrastructure]
- **Export Service Extension:** Enhance existing RecoveryExportService to include vault data
- **Manifest Format:** Extend existing manifest JSON schema to document vault contents
- **Encryption Consistency:** Maintain AES-256 encryption for vault data during bundle creation
- **Import Service:** Extend existing import functionality to restore vault data

### Architecture Pattern Integration
[Source: existing export/import system and vault repositories]
- **Bundle Creator:** Extend existing bundle creation with vault data serialization
- **Manifest Manager:** Update manifest generation to include vault component documentation
- **Security Policy:** Implement vault inclusion policies based on user roles and preferences
- **Version Compatibility:** Ensure bundle format maintains backward compatibility

### Bundle Format Requirements
Based on existing recovery bundle structure and vault data needs:
- **Bundle Structure:** Maintain existing directory structure with new `vault/` subdirectory
- **Vault Data Format:** Export vault contents as encrypted JSON with metadata
- **Manifest Schema:** Extend existing manifest to include vault component checksums and versions
- **Security Metadata:** Include vault encryption parameters and access requirements

### Security Considerations
[Source: NFR2 and existing security requirements]
- Vault data must remain encrypted during export and bundle creation
- Bundle integrity must be verified with checksums for all components
- Access control metadata must be preserved for proper import validation
- Sensitive data must not appear in plain text in manifest or metadata

### Integration Points
[Source: existing export system implementation]
- Extend existing asset export UI with vault inclusion options
- Integrate with existing bundle creation workflow
- Maintain existing export performance requirements (sub-2-second for configs)
- Support existing bundle formats for backward compatibility

## Notes

This story integrates the Asset Identity Vault system with the existing recovery bundle export functionality, creating a comprehensive asset recovery solution. Engineers can now export complete packages that include configuration files, firmware, and credential information, enabling full asset recovery from a single bundle. The implementation maintains security standards and provides flexible options for including or excluding sensitive vault data based on organizational security policies.
