# Secure OT Configuration Management Platform Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### 1. Goals and Background Context

#### Goals

- Reduce the average time for an engineer to recover a device using a "golden" configuration to under 5 minutes.

- Achieve high user adoption by creating a highly polished, intuitive platform that engineers prefer over insecure, ad-hoc methods.

- Establish a market foothold with a successful MVP that can be expanded into a future enterprise-tier product.

- Increase engineer confidence in the integrity of their configurations and change management processes.

#### Background Context

The platform addresses a critical gap in the Operational Technology (OT) and Industrial Control Systems (ICS) space. Engineers currently rely on risky, inefficient methods like USB drives and network shares for managing vital equipment configurations. This leads to extended downtime during failures and lacks the security and auditability required in modern industrial environments. This PRD outlines the requirements for an offline-first, secure, and user-friendly platform to solve this problem.

### 2. Requirements

#### Functional

1. **FR1:** The system MUST provide a secure, local repository to import, store, and manage equipment configuration files.

2. **FR2:** The system MUST support both text-based and proprietary binary file formats.

3. **FR3:** The system MUST automatically create a new, versioned entry for a configuration file each time it is updated.

4. **FR4:** The system MUST maintain a complete, auditable history for each configuration, tracking the author, timestamp, and user-provided notes for every version.

5. **FR5:** Users MUST be able to create a "branch" from any configuration version to work on changes in isolation.

6. **FR6:** Users MUST be able to assign a status to any configuration version (e.g., `Draft`, `Approved`, `Golden`).

7. **FR7:** The system MUST provide a guided, wizard-like interface for promoting a configuration version to the official "Golden" status.

8. **FR8:** Users MUST be able to select any previous version from a configuration's history and restore/export it with a single action.

9. **FR9:** The system MUST require users to log in with a unique username and password to access the platform.

10. **FR10:** The system MUST support at least two user roles: `Administrator` and `Engineer`.

11. **FR11:** An `Administrator` MUST be able to create, manage, and deactivate `Engineer` user accounts locally within the application.

#### Non-Functional

1. **NFR1:** The system MUST be fully functional in a completely disconnected, offline environment.

2. **NFR2:** All configuration files stored at rest within the local repository MUST be encrypted using AES-256 or a superior, industry-standard algorithm.

3. **NFR3:** Critical user operations (e.g., reverting to a golden image, viewing history) MUST complete in under 2 seconds.

4. **NFR4:** The user interface MUST be designed for simplicity and intuitive operation by non-developer technical personnel.

5. **NFR5:** The system MUST support an optional, user-initiated, end-to-end encrypted channel for software updates and anonymous telemetry sync.

6. **NFR6:** The application MUST be able to run on current versions of Windows, macOS, and Linux.

7. **NFR7:** All user passwords MUST be securely stored using a modern, salt-based hashing algorithm (e.g., Argon2 or bcrypt).

### 3. User Interface Design Goals

#### Overall UX Vision

The UX vision is to create a calm, clear, and trustworthy tool that empowers OT engineers, especially when they are under pressure. The interface must prioritize safety and simplicity over feature density, guiding users through complex version control concepts with an intuitive, step-by-step approach. The user should always feel confident and in control.

#### Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Wizard-Driven Workflows:** Key processes like "Promote to Golden" or creating a new branch will be guided by simple, multi-step wizards.

- **Visual History:** Configuration history will be presented as a clear, visual timeline, not just a text-based log.

- **"Single Pane of Glass" Dashboard:** A main dashboard will provide an at-a-glance overview of all managed devices and the status of their configurations.

- **Strong Status Cues:** The status of any configuration (`Golden`, `Approved`, `Draft`, etc.) will be immediately obvious through prominent labels and color-coding.

#### Core Screens and Views

- **Login Screen:** A secure screen for user authentication.

- **Main Dashboard:** Lists all managed devices/assets.

- **Device Detail View:** Shows the version history timeline for a single device.

- **Version Details Pane:** Displays the metadata for a specific version (author, notes, test results, etc.).

- **User Management Screen:** A simple interface for administrators to manage user accounts.

#### Accessibility: WCAG AA

To ensure the product is usable by the widest range of engineers, the UI should meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA as a minimum standard.

#### Branding

The visual design should be clean, professional, and utilitarian. It should inspire confidence and trust. The color palette should be used meaningfully to convey status and warnings (e.g., green for `Golden`, red for critical alerts).

#### Target Device and Platforms: Cross-Platform

The application is a desktop product that must run natively on Windows, macOS, and Linux, and its UI must be responsive to typical desktop and laptop screen sizes.

---

### 4. Technical Assumptions

#### Repository Structure: Monorepo

The project will be managed within a single monorepo.

- **Rationale:** This approach will simplify dependency management and code sharing between the core desktop application and future components, such as the DMZ proxy or an update server.

#### Service Architecture: Modular Monolith with Serverless Sync

The desktop application itself will be a modular monolith. The optional, intermittent sync functionality will be supported by a serverless backend (e.g., using AWS Lambda or similar).

- **Rationale:** The desktop app is naturally a self-contained unit (a monolith), but enforcing modularity internally will make it easier to maintain and extend. A serverless backend for the sync feature is highly cost-effective and scalable, perfectly suited for infrequent connections.

#### Testing Requirements: Unit + Integration

The MVP will require comprehensive unit tests for individual components and integration tests to ensure these components work together correctly.

- **Rationale:** This two-layered approach is critical for a high-trust product. It ensures that both the smallest pieces of logic and their interactions are reliable and function as expected.

#### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

The application will be built using the Tauri framework. The core backend logic ("Engine") will be written in Rust for maximum security and performance. The user interface ("Dashboard") will be built with React and TypeScript to ensure a polished and modern user experience. An embedded, encrypted local database (e.g., SQLite via a Rust crate) will be used for storage.

    3. The Administrator can deactivate and reactivate existing `Engineer` accounts.

    4. `Engineer` users do not see the "User Management" area.

#### Story 1.4: Import Configuration and Create First Version

As an Engineer, I want to import a configuration file for a new asset, so that it is securely stored and versioned in the platform.

- **Acceptance Criteria:**

    1. From the main dashboard, a logged-in user can select an "Import Configuration" action.

    2. The user is prompted to select a file from their local system.

    3. The user must provide a name for the asset/device (e.g., "PLC-Line5") and can add initial commit notes.

    4. Upon saving, the file is stored encrypted in the local database.

    5. A new version record (v1) is created, associated with the asset, and includes the author's username, timestamp, and notes.

    6. The newly created asset appears on the main dashboard.

#### Story 1.5: View Configuration History

As an Engineer, I want to view the complete version history of an asset, so that I have a full audit trail of all changes.

- **Acceptance Criteria:**

    1. Clicking on an asset from the dashboard navigates to a "History View."

    2. The History View displays a list of all saved versions in reverse chronological order.

    3. Each entry in the list clearly shows the version number, author, timestamp, and the user's notes for that change.

    4. The view is performant and loads in under 2 seconds.

### Epic 2 Advanced Configuration Management

**Epic Goal:** Empower engineers with advanced workflows to safely manage configuration changes using branching, status promotion, and one-click restore capabilities. This epic transforms the platform from a passive "vault" into an active, powerful tool for change management and disaster recovery.

#### Story 2.1: Create a Branch

As an Engineer, I want to create a branch from an existing configuration version, so that I can safely experiment with changes without affecting the main line of development.

- **Acceptance Criteria:**

    1. From the "History View" of an asset, the user can select any version.

    2. An action is available to "Create Branch from this Version."

    3. The user must provide a name for the new branch (e.g., "test-new-parameters").

    4. The new branch appears in the UI, clearly showing its relationship to the parent version it was branched from.

#### Story 2.2: Add New Version to a Branch

As an Engineer, I want to add a new configuration version to the branch I created, so that I can save my work-in-progress.

- **Acceptance Criteria:**

    1. The user can select an active branch.

    2. The user can use an "Update Branch" action to import a new version of the configuration file.

    3. The user must add notes for the new version.

    4. The new version is added to the history of that specific branch only.

    5. The main version history of the asset is not affected.

#### Story 2.3: Assign Configuration Status

As an Engineer, I want to assign a status to a configuration version, so that I and others know its state of readiness.

- **Acceptance Criteria:**

    1. In the history view, each version has a visible status (defaulting to `Draft`).

    2. A user can change the status of a version to `Approved`.

    3. The status is clearly displayed with a distinct color or icon.

    4. Only an `Administrator` can change a status back from `Approved` to `Draft`.

#### Story 2.4: Promote Version to "Golden Image"

As an Engineer, I want to use a guided wizard to promote an approved configuration to the official "Golden Image", so that it is clearly marked as the trusted, master version for disaster recovery.

- **Acceptance Criteria:**

    1. A "Promote to Golden" action is available only on versions with an `Approved` status.

    2. Activating this starts a wizard that explains the action and asks for final confirmation.

    3. Upon confirmation, the version's status is changed to `Golden`.

    4. If another version of the same asset was previously `Golden`, its status is automatically changed to `Archived`.

    5. The `Golden` version is prominently displayed on the asset's main view.

#### Story 2.5: Revert to a Previous Version

As an Engineer, I want to quickly restore any previous configuration version, so that I can rapidly recover from a failed deployment or equipment failure.

- **Acceptance Criteria:**

    1. Every version in the history view has a "Restore" or "Export" button.

    2. Clicking the button prompts the user for confirmation.

    3. Upon confirmation, the system exports the exact file for that selected version to a location the user chooses on their local machine.

    4. The export process is completed in under 2 seconds.
