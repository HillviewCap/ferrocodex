# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Reduce the average time for an engineer to recover a device using a "golden" configuration to under 5 minutes.
    
- Achieve high user adoption by creating a highly polished, intuitive platform that engineers prefer over insecure, ad-hoc methods.
    
- Establish a market foothold with a successful MVP that can be expanded into a future enterprise-tier product.
    
- Increase engineer confidence in the integrity of their configurations and change management processes.
    

## Background Context

The platform addresses a critical gap in the Operational Technology (OT) and Industrial Control Systems (ICS) space. Engineers currently rely on risky, inefficient methods like USB drives and network shares for managing vital equipment configurations. This leads to extended downtime during failures and lacks the security and auditability required in modern industrial environments. This PRD outlines the requirements for an offline-first, secure, and user-friendly platform to solve this problem.
