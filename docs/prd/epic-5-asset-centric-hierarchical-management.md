# Epic 5: Asset-Centric Hierarchical Management [v0.5.0]

**Epic Goal:** Transform the platform into a comprehensive hierarchical asset management system with customizable metadata, cybersecurity-compliant naming, and intuitive folder-based organization that prioritizes simplicity while enabling complex asset relationships.

## Core User Stories

### Story 5.1: Hierarchical Asset Creation
As an Engineer, I want to create asset folders and individual device records in a hierarchical structure, so that I can organize my industrial environment logically (e.g., "Production Line 1" → "PLC-001", "HMI-002").

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Users can create "folder" type assets that act as containers
2. Users can create "device" type assets within folders or at root level
3. Folders can be nested to unlimited depth
4. Clear visual distinction between folders and devices in UI
5. Drag-and-drop organization between folders

### Story 5.2: Customizable Asset Metadata System
As an Engineer, I want to define custom fields for my assets (IP address, location, install date, facility, notes), so that I can capture all relevant information for each device type without being limited to predefined fields.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Pre-built field templates available (IP, location, install date, facility, notes)
2. Users can add custom fields with validation rules
3. Field types support: text, number, date, dropdown, checkbox
4. JSON Schema validation ensures data integrity
5. Metadata searchable and filterable

### Story 5.3: Cybersecurity-Compliant File Naming
As an Administrator, I want all asset names, folders, and files to follow cybersecurity best practices, so that the system is protected from naming-based vulnerabilities.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Asset names follow pattern: `^[A-Z0-9][A-Z0-9_-]{2,49}$`
2. Forbidden Windows reserved names blocked
3. File uploads sanitized and validated
4. SHA-256 hash verification for all files
5. Security classification tagging system

### Story 5.4: Asset-First Configuration Workflow
As an Engineer, I want to create an asset first, then associate configurations and firmware to it, so that I have a complete asset record before importing any files.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Asset creation wizard guides through metadata setup
2. Configuration import requires existing asset selection
3. Firmware import requires existing asset selection
4. Clear asset → configuration → firmware relationship in UI
5. Bulk import capabilities for multiple assets

### Story 5.5: Enhanced Asset Management Interface
As an Engineer, I want an intuitive tree-based navigation interface, so that I can easily browse, organize, and manage hundreds of assets across multiple production lines.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Tree navigation with expand/collapse folders
2. Search across asset names and metadata
3. Advanced filtering by asset type, metadata fields
4. Bulk operations (move, delete, export multiple assets)
5. Breadcrumb navigation for deep hierarchies
