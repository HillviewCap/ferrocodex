# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The UX vision is to create a calm, clear, and trustworthy tool that empowers OT engineers, especially when they are under pressure. The interface must prioritize safety and simplicity over feature density, guiding users through complex version control concepts with an intuitive, step-by-step approach. The user should always feel confident and in control.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Wizard-Driven Workflows:** Key processes like "Promote to Golden" or creating a new branch will be guided by simple, multi-step wizards.
    
- **Visual History:** Configuration history will be presented as a clear, visual timeline, not just a text-based log.
    
- **"Single Pane of Glass" Dashboard:** A main dashboard will provide an at-a-glance overview of all managed devices and the status of their configurations.
    
- **Strong Status Cues:** The status of any configuration (`Golden`, `Approved`, `Draft`, etc.) will be immediately obvious through prominent labels and color-coding.
    

## Core Screens and Views

- **Login Screen:** A secure screen for user authentication.
    
- **Main Dashboard:** Lists all managed devices/assets.
    
- **Device Detail View:** Shows the version history timeline for a single device.
    
- **Version Details Pane:** Displays the metadata for a specific version (author, notes, test results, etc.).
    
- **User Management Screen:** A simple interface for administrators to manage user accounts.
    

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

To ensure the product is usable by the widest range of engineers, the UI should meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA as a minimum standard.

## Branding

The visual design should be clean, professional, and utilitarian. It should inspire confidence and trust. The color palette should be used meaningfully to convey status and warnings (e.g., green for `Golden`, red for critical alerts).

## Target Device and Platforms: Cross-Platform

The application is a desktop product that must run natively on Windows, macOS, and Linux, and its UI must be responsive to typical desktop and laptop screen sizes.
