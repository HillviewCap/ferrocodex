# Requirements

## Functional

1. **FR1:** The system MUST provide a secure, local repository to import, store, and manage equipment configuration files.
    
2. **FR2:** The system MUST support both text-based and proprietary binary file formats.
    
3. **FR3:** The system MUST automatically create a new, versioned entry for a configuration file each time it is updated.
    
4. **FR4:** The system MUST maintain a complete, auditable history for each configuration, tracking the author, timestamp, and user-provided notes for every version.
    
5. **FR5:** Users MUST be able to create a "branch" from any configuration version to work on changes in isolation.
    
6. **FR6:** Users MUST be able to assign a status to any configuration version (e.g., `Draft`, `Approved`, `Golden`).
    
7. **FR7:** The system MUST provide a guided, wizard-like interface for promoting a configuration version to the official "Golden" status.
    
8. **FR8:** Users MUST be able to select any previous version from a configuration's history and restore/export it with a single action.
    
9. **FR9:** The system MUST require users to log in with a unique username and password to access the platform.
    
10. **FR10:** The system MUST support at least two user roles: `Administrator` and `Engineer`.
    
11. **FR11:** An `Administrator` MUST be able to create, manage, and deactivate `Engineer` user accounts locally within the application.
    

## Non-Functional

1. **NFR1:** The system MUST be fully functional in a completely disconnected, offline environment.
    
2. **NFR2:** All configuration files stored at rest within the local repository MUST be encrypted using AES-256 or a superior, industry-standard algorithm.
    
3. **NFR3:** Critical user operations (e.g., reverting to a golden image, viewing history) MUST complete in under 2 seconds.
    
4. **NFR4:** The user interface MUST be designed for simplicity and intuitive operation by non-developer technical personnel.
    
5. **NFR5:** The system MUST support an optional, user-initiated, end-to-end encrypted channel for software updates and anonymous telemetry sync.
    
6. **NFR6:** The application MUST be able to run on current versions of Windows, macOS, and Linux.
    
7. **NFR7:** All user passwords MUST be securely stored using a modern, salt-based hashing algorithm (e.g., Argon2 or bcrypt).
