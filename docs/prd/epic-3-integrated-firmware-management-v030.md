# Epic 3 Integrated Firmware Management [v0.3.0]

**Epic Goal:** Transform the platform into a comprehensive asset recovery solution by adding secure firmware storage, automated analysis, and integrated management capabilities. This epic extends the platform's value proposition from configuration-only to complete asset recovery.

## Story 3.1: Import and Store Firmware

As an Engineer, I want to import firmware files for my assets, so that I have a complete recovery solution including both firmware and configuration.

* **Acceptance Criteria:**

  1. From an asset's detail view, users can access a "Firmware" tab.

  2. Users can upload firmware files of any size (up to system limits).

  3. The system stores firmware files encrypted on the native file system.

  4. Firmware metadata is stored in the database with version tracking.

  5. Upload progress is displayed for large files.

## Story 3.2: Automated Firmware Analysis

As an Engineer, I want the system to automatically analyze uploaded firmware, so that I can understand its contents and verify integrity.

* **Acceptance Criteria:**

  1. Upon firmware upload, the system automatically initiates analysis.

  2. Analysis runs in the background without blocking the UI.

  3. Results include file type detection, embedded version information, and basic security checks.

  4. Analysis results are displayed in a clear, readable format.

  5. Users can view analysis results for any firmware version.

## Story 3.3: Link Firmware to Configuration

As an Engineer, I want to associate firmware versions with configuration versions, so that I can manage complete asset recovery packages.

* **Acceptance Criteria:**

  1. When viewing a configuration version, users can link it to a firmware version.

  2. The link is bidirectional and visible from both firmware and configuration views.

  3. The system tracks which firmware/configuration combinations are known to work together.

  4. Linked versions can be exported together as a recovery package.

## Story 3.4: Firmware Version Management

As an Engineer, I want to manage firmware versions with the same workflow as configurations, so that I have consistent version control across all asset components.

* **Acceptance Criteria:**

  1. Firmware versions support the same status workflow (Draft, Approved, Golden, Archived).

  2. Users can add notes to firmware versions.

  3. Firmware history is displayed in a timeline similar to configurations.

  4. The same role-based permissions apply to firmware management.

## Story 3.5: Complete Asset Recovery

As an Engineer, I want to export both firmware and configuration for an asset, so that I can perform complete recovery in a single operation.

* **Acceptance Criteria:**

  1. A "Complete Recovery" option is available for assets with both firmware and configuration.

  2. Users can select specific versions of both firmware and configuration to export.

  3. The system exports both files to a user-selected location.

  4. Export includes a manifest file documenting versions and checksums.

  5. The entire export process maintains sub-2-second performance for configurations (firmware may take longer based on size).

This concludes the FerroCodex Product Requirements Document v0.3.0. The platform now addresses the complete asset recovery scenario, providing engineers with a comprehensive, secure, and user-friendly solution for managing both configurations and firmware in critical OT environments.
