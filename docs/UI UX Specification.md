# Secure OT Configuration Management Platform UI/UX Specification

### 1. Overall UX Goals & Principles

#### Target User Personas

- **Primary: The On-Site OT Engineer:** Hands-on, under pressure, needs speed, safety, and simplicity.
    
- **Secondary: The Engineering Manager:** Needs to see audit trails, ensure compliance, and manage team access.
    

#### Usability Goals

- **Ease of Learning:** A new engineer can complete the core recovery workflow in under 10 minutes without training.
    
- **Efficiency Under Pressure:** Critical tasks must be discoverable and executable with a minimal number of clicks.
    
- **Error Prevention:** The design must actively prevent users from making catastrophic mistakes.
    
- **Trust & Confidence:** The user must feel absolute confidence in the integrity of the data presented.
    

#### Design Principles

1. **Safety First, Clarity Always:** Prioritize preventing user error and clearly communicating system status.
    
2. **Guide, Don't Assume:** Use wizard-driven workflows for complex tasks.
    
3. **Calm in a Crisis:** The interface must be uncluttered and easy to navigate.
    
4. **Trust Through Transparency:** Visually represent version history and configuration status.

### 2. Information Architecture (IA)

#### Site Map / Screen Inventory

Code snippet

```
graph TD
    A[Login Screen] --> B(Main Dashboard);
    B --> C{Device/Asset List};
    C --> D[Device Detail View];
    D --> E[Version History Timeline];
    B --> F[User Management];
    subgraph "Admin Only"
        F
    end
    subgraph "Main Workflow"
        C
        D
        E
    end
```

#### Navigation Structure

- **Primary Navigation:** A persistent sidebar with links to "Main Dashboard" and (for Admins) "User Management."
    
- **Secondary Navigation:** Contextual controls within each view.
    
- **Breadcrumb Strategy:** A breadcrumb trail will be displayed for easy navigation (e.g., `Dashboard > PLC-Line5 > History`).

### 3. User Flows

_(Flows for Disaster Recovery, Making a Safe Change, Approving & Promoting, and First-Time Setup are documented as discussed.)_

---

### 4. Wireframes & Mockups

**Primary Design Files:** To Be Determined. We will start with low-fidelity ASCII wireframes.

#### Key Screen Layouts

_(ASCII wireframes for the Main Dashboard, Device Detail View, and User Management screen are documented as created.)_

---

### 5. Component Library / Design System

**Design System Approach:** The project will use the **Ant Design (AntD)** pre-built component library to ensure a high-quality, consistent UI while accelerating development.

**Core Components:** `Layout`, `Button`, `Table`, `Form`, `Input`, `Breadcrumb`, `Tag`, `Modal`, `Timeline`.

### 6. Branding & Style Guide

#### Color Palette

|Color Type|Hex Code|Usage|
|---|---|---|
|Primary|`#003049`|Primary buttons, links, active states|
|Secondary|`#fdf0d5`|Main background color|
|Accent|`#669bbc`|Secondary highlights, hover states|
|Success|`#606c38`|Positive feedback, confirmations|
|Warning|`#dda15e`|Cautions, important notices|
|Error|`#c1121f`|Errors, destructive action alerts|

#### Typography

- **Font Family:** System UI font stack.

### 7. Accessibility Requirements

**Compliance Target:** WCAG 2.1, Level AA. Key requirements include sufficient color contrast, keyboard-only navigation, and screen reader support.

---

### 8. Responsiveness Strategy

The application will use a fluid layout to adapt to desktop window sizes, with a minimum constrained width of 800px.

---

### 9. Animation & Micro-interactions

Animations will be purposeful, fast, and subtle, focusing on providing user feedback and enhancing clarity.

---

### 10. Performance Considerations

Performance Goals: Views will load in under 1 second, and interactions will have feedback in under 100ms.

Design Strategies: List virtualization will be used for long history timelines to maintain a responsive UI.
