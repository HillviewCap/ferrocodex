# Secure OT Configuration Management Platform Fullstack Architecture Document

### 1. Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for the Secure OT Configuration Management Platform, including the backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

#### Starter Template or Existing Project

The project will be built using the Tauri framework, which integrates a Rust-based backend with a web-based frontend. This choice was finalized in the PRD and serves as our foundational "starter," providing a secure, performant, and cross-platform application shell from the outset.

#### Change Log

|Date|Version|Description|Author|

### 2. High Level Architecture

#### Technical Summary

The system is a cross-platform desktop application built using the Tauri framework, which features a Rust backend for maximum security and performance, and a React frontend for a polished user interface. It operates primarily as a modular monolith in an offline-first model, storing all data in a local, encrypted SQLite database. A monorepo structure will manage the codebase. For the optional, intermittent sync feature, the application will communicate with a secure, serverless backend hosted on AWS, ensuring scalability and cost-efficiency. The architecture prioritizes security, data integrity, and a responsive, intuitive experience for OT engineers.

#### Platform and Infrastructure Choice

- **Platform:** AWS (Amazon Web Services) will be used for the optional sync and update functionality.
    
- **Key Services:** AWS Lambda (for compute), API Gateway (for the sync endpoint), S3 (for software update storage), and Cognito (for potential future cloud identity services).
    
- **Deployment Host and Regions:** The desktop application is self-hosted by the user. The serverless backend will be deployed to `us-east-1` and `eu-west-1` for redundancy.
    

#### Repository Structure

- **Structure:** Monorepo.
    
- **Monorepo Tool:** Turborepo is recommended to manage workspaces and optimize build processes.
    
- **Package Organization:** The monorepo will contain separate packages for the Tauri application (`apps/desktop`) and any future cloud infrastructure or shared libraries (`packages/shared-types`).

```

    subgraph User's Environment
        A[User: OT Engineer] -- Interacts with --> B[Tauri Desktop App];
        B -- Contains --> C[React UI];
        B -- Contains --> D[Rust Core Logic];
        D -- Reads/Writes --> E[Encrypted SQLite DB];
    end

    subgraph AWS Cloud (Optional Sync)
        F[API Gateway] --> G[AWS Lambda];
        G --> H[Amazon S3];
    end

    B -- User-Initiated Sync --> F;
```

#### Architectural Patterns

- **Modular Monolith (Desktop App):** The core application is a single deployable unit, but its internal code will be structured in a modular way to ensure maintainability and separation of concerns.
    
- **Serverless (Cloud Sync):** The backend for handling software updates and optional telemetry will be built using serverless functions to ensure it is scalable and cost-effective.
    
- **Component-Based UI:** The React frontend will be built as a collection of reusable, stateless, and well-defined components.
    
- **Repository Pattern (Rust Core):** The Rust backend will use the repository pattern to abstract the database logic from the core business logic.

This concludes the `greenfield-fullstack` planning workflow. All required artifacts—the Project Brief, PRD, UI/UX Specification, and this Architecture Document—are now complete.

The project is fully specified and ready to transition from planning to the development phase. The next step is to move to an IDE environment where a **Scrum Master** will begin creating user stories for the **Developer** to implement, starting with Epic 1.

Thank you for your collaboration. The BMad team is ready for the next phase when you are.
